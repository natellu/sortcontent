              "selftext": "For those who are curious, here is a picture: [https://imgur.com/a/LIbBk6A](https://imgur.com/a/LIbBk6A)\n\n\n\n**What is Perry Rhodan you may ask?**\n\nPerry Rhodan is from Germany and the longest running SciFI Series in the world. The first novel booklet was released in September 1961. Since then, they have released a novel booklet, which is about 50-70 pages of full text, every single week, not missing a single instance. This week they released Novel Booklet No. 3082. Obviously there are multiple people planning and writing the story together.\n\n**Why are there books at the top of your picture?**\n\nI have the first 1099 novel Booklets in book form. Each book contains multiple novel booklets, roughly 6-8 (it depends), to make it easier to read (and store). The “summary” books started after the original series, so they are behind the first edition. Therefore I decided to quite the books at Book No 129 ( Novel Booklet 1099, or end of the 11th Story Cycle) and switch to the original novel booklets.\n\nIn the top left corner you can see Book 1, containing Booklets 1-8, and book 129 at the bottom of the shelf. The series then continues in the boxes.Each of my boxes contains 70 novel booklets, with one at the front with a nice visible front. I did put double sided tape at the front and a transparent cover, so that I can put different  novel booklets and design in there, what ever I feel like.The boxes therefore contain novel booklet 1100-3082, the newest, + a box with bonus booklets.\n\n**What is the story about?**\n\nWritten in 1961, the story starts in 1971, back then 10 years in the future. The main character is an astronaut and the first man on the moon. But on the moon, he discovers a spaceship from another species. The series than goes on with what would happen it mankind would suddenly be catapulted into the technological future from one day to the next day. What would we do with such power? And then, mankinds long journey into space begins…\n\nBefore you ask: Yes, it is one single story line (with lots of sub-plots obviously), but generally, behind every cycle (mostly 100 booklets) is a super-cylce which contains multiple cycles and is often about 400-600 booklets long. Its like your favourite book/series never ends.Also: I didn’t finish reading everything, and it will still take me multiple years (depends how frequently I read) to finish all the booklets, considering they put out 53 new ones each year.\n\nI dont know, I just wanted to share that. Thank you for reading, have a great day!\n\nEDIT: As some are asking: No, I didnt read it all (yet). Per my calculations, if I would read one booklet a day (60-70 pages), it would still take me years to finish it, considering they do put out thousands of new pages each year.\n\nEDIT2: Funfact: This Main Series is not even close to everything in the Universe. They do have a reboot of the Series, which is currently at Booklet No 260 or so (200 pages per booklet this time), they have a 12-part MiniSeries each year now, they do have a novel booklet series of a side charackter with roughly 900 booklets and more. I could continue, but I think you get the point :D\n\nEDIT3: They are releasing 7 silver books every 2 years, so 3 1/2 every year. Those contain way less than the booklets they put out. Therefore the silver books are falling more and more behind. If they would stop putting out booklet novels this week, they would have to release Silver Books until the 2090s to catch up! One of the other reasons why I switched to the novel booklets!\n\nEDIT4: Here are the technical drawings of the spaceships they include in a lot of the booklets: https://www.pr-materiequelle.de/riss/seiten/l1700.htm . Together with the great cover I just love the details. Thanks to /u/Gezzaia for the link"

Many of you upvoted request made by u/lyrajc and u/Nolzi to add the ability to edit TXT records for you dynamic domains.  I'm happy to announce that I have implemented it, and it would be great if you could find some time to try and test it. (It's not announced yet on my website, and I consider it a beta feature for now).\n\nThe new parameter name is  `&txt=`\n\nFor example:\n\n    https://freemyip.com/update?token=YOUR_TOKEN&domain=domain.freemyip.com&txt=my%20test%20text\n\nThen from a Linux host, you can use this to see it:\n\n    $ host -t TXT domain.freemyip.com \n    domain.freemyip.com descriptive text \"my test text\"\n\nIt will also automagically work for any subdomain within your domain, eg:\n\n    $ host -t TXT blahblah.domain.freemyip.com\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to remove your TXT record, do this  `&txt=null`\n\nYou can also add parameter `&verbose=yes` to see some more information in the output, especially if you encounter an error.\n\nAny time you change anything, you will have to wait around 1 minute for DNS cache to get updated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions, or if you encounter any issues, please let me know."

Right now I can get it working by either (a.) injecting the shellcode into my own process via VirtualAlloc or by (b.) injecting the shellcode into a remote process of the same integrity level via VirtualAlloc and CreatRemoteThread ( I was kind of surprised this didn't get caught). I was going to try to implement my own reflective DLL injection for fun but put that on hold for now as these basic techniques are still working. I have the loader set up right now to beacon to my kali VM, retrieve the stager shellcode that I want to use, then execute it.\n\nSo I can get a session established and can run lightweight commands like getuid and sysinfo, but whenever I try to do something like download a file, screenshot, getsystem, I immediately get caught and quarantined. I'm not really surprised about screenshot and getsystem getting caught, but I was pretty surprised at download getting identified so quickly.\n\nMy question is: is there an efficient way of evading this behavior detection? Would I need to modify the API calls that meterpreter is using? Where is the file that I would need to modify (presumably the meterpreter server dll source)? I've been trying to find resources online about this but I'm not seeing much of anything."

This is all to be able to fill up a Define 7 XL (18 drives max)) and can come in the form of 1 or 2 cards.\n\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses so far, but I feel like all the responses are more or less just to get the cheap ebay cards with no new recommendations. Is this really so one sided there are no new options that anyone has to recommend?"

See [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/i8drqz/i_was_asked_to_fix_chairs_today_i_refused_now/)\n\nBefore going on with my story, i would like to thank you for the overwhelming support and answers you left on my post. I tried to read as many as I can. I also would like to address some of the comments i got that i shouldn't act princessy and get my hands dirty every now and then: I agree. I do that gladly when it is something need to be done, something i can do or learn to do. I re-arranged the whole two buildings my company have after Covid19 for safe distances and i manually built separation walls between tables. This included re-wiring entire departments. I worked physically to the level of opening the underground pipes. I move and carry furniture and I do that more than any other admin since I am the youngest.\n\nThe point is, i really get my hands dirty and i help a lot, but this was different. I was handed a bag of grease and thrown in a dirty steaming hot basement with more than 20 old broken chairs. It is different. AND i do have many projects to do. AND i really have ZERO idea how to fix a chair. AND i genuinely believe it is not something i can fix or should be fixed. Those chairs are very old, mostly with loose backs, broken arms and some of them are totally destroyed, like the whole seat part is out of the base. I would just throw them away if they were mine and simply order new ones and that's another reason why i felt this is BS. The boss is just acting cheap. AND my company isn’t a small one. We are two buildings each with multiple floors and I support around 200 people locally and another 100 remotely.\n\nAnyway, **I got fired today.** Fortunately, according to most of you. If you like to know the details, continue reading, if you are busy or bored, just thank you for your advice and I am looking for a new job already.\n\ni had the meeting with my boss and HR today. Thanks to you i was prepared for it and I knew what to say and how to approach the issue. I researched the working laws in this country, since i am a foreigner here and I even consulted a friend who’s a lawyer.  However and for my surprise the boss didn't say a single word.  Only the HR lady spoke and she said that's due to Covid19 they need to let some of us go and since i am one of the younger ones with no family on my back it made sense to start with me and that they wish me all the best bla bla.\n\nFor a moment i felt speechless, since i expected the discussion to revolve around the chair-reparing incident, then i decided to bring it up anyway. I told the HR lady that i find the timing funny, how this happened right after the incident. And not to my surprise, she had no idea what I'm talking about. She asked me about it and I felt she was genuinely surprised. She smiled kinda nervously and asked the boss to clarify that, he didn’t. he just asked me “not to be silly”. Then he left the whole room for “phone calls”. He thanked me with a fake smile and wished me a good luck. He even said, “You have a great attitude in life and I’m sure you will thrive elsewhere”. \n\nWhen he left, the HR lady kept talking to me for 30 minutes. She said even if she believes me, and she does, she wouldn’t be able to help because I basically have no evidence of my conversation with him about the chairs. She said she can’t do much but she offered to get me two up to three months of salary and  to write me an experience certificate and I took both her offers and decided to get it over with.\n\nNow I am having a beer on the balcony of my soon-to-be old office and writing you this. I think I did like this job and a part of me feels sad after this meeting but still I don’t feel guilty. Most likely I will find a better job. I hope so. You think so too. Don’t you?"

We passed surreptitious winks when we thought nobody watched. We smiled in a spring downpour in a forest as birds chirped and squirrels scampered and her tears of joy mixed with raindrops as she, too, got down on one knee and said yes to me a hundred times.\n\nHappily ever after should have come next. We had no doubts, no qualms about the future, no ifs or buts or reservations.\n\nWe bought a house. Settled down. Started talking about having kids, and everything we'd have to do to prepare. It wasn't a matter of \"if\"; \"when\" was the only question.\n\nIt was summer of that year when it snowed for Easter, when the flowers had begun to bloom just for late frosts to beat them back, and the moisture from melting snow and incessant rain seeped inside due to poor sloping in the cramped caverns below the deck out behind the house.\n\nI donned my best workman's outfit: those old jeans D called \"dad jeans\" and a shirt she'd forbidden me from wearing around the house.\n\n\"More hole than shirt,\" she'd called it.\n\nCentipedes scurried. Spiders licked their little fangs at the thought of a human-sized meal. I cleared their webs with one hand and grimaced as others crawled around me and over me.\n\nSomething sparkled from the phone flashlight's beam. I crawled closer. More sparkled. Coins. Diamonds. Golden goblets and fine silver. Some were dirtied as if they'd sat there for years. Others not so much.\n\n\"What the fuck?\" I muttered to nothing but the spiders and centipedes.\n\nI backed out the way I'd come, didn't bother changing out of my work clothes as I waited for D to get home from work.\n\nShe entered cheery as ever, smiling so wide she glowed. Better that than the days where she came home piping mad about something that had happened at work. Mad enough I swore she spouted smoke from her nostrils.\n\n\"Is everything alright, dear?\" she asked, looking me up and down. \"Your clothes are all muddy.\"\n\n\"They are, aren't they? I was underneath the deck checking on the sloping. I think that's why we have water in the basement.\"\n\nShe turned a slight shade of pale but recovered just as quickly. \"Underneath the deck? No wonder you're muddy. Why don't you go change and--\"\n\n\"Have you been down there?\" I interrupted.\n\nHer key chain rattled as it hung loose in her hands. She looked at her feet.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said finally.\n\n\"That's odd. Why? Don't get me wrong, you're as entitled to being down there as I am, I'm just wondering if maybe you saw the pile of treasure there was.\"\n\n\"Was?\" She stood up straighter, alarmed.\n\n\"Is. I didn't touch it.\"\n\nD didn't lie. Not that I knew of, at least. But she sure did seem to be treading that thin line between a bold-faced lie and a lie by omission.\n\n\"It's mine,\" she admitted in response to my judgmental silence.\n\n\"Yours?\"\n\nSince we'd met, nothing was \"hers\" or \"mine\" other than toothbrushes and underwear. The cars were ours, the house was ours--even the leftovers in the fridge became a lawless first-come-first-serve that neither of us minded.\n\n\"Ours, I guess,\" she said with more than a little reluctance.\n\n\"It can be yours,\" I said. \"I just don't quite understand how it got there.\"\n\n\"It's a long story,\" D said.\n\nI shrugged. It was a Friday night. I had all the time in the world, at least until Monday.\n\n\"Might as well get started,\" I said.\n\nD sighed. \"I'm a dragon. That's my hoard. Er, our hoard, I mean.\"\n\nI nearly spit out the water I'd sipped. \"A dragon. Right. And I'm a genie, rub my bottle and I'll grant you three wishes. Come on, D. I'm being serious.\"\n\n\"Me, too.\"\n\n\"A dragon. Like a lizard person? That's silly, D. It's some nut-job conspiracy theory. We laugh at those people, don't tell me you've become one of them.\"\n\n\"You laugh at them,\" D said. \"I listen.\"\n\n\"A dragon. Prove it, I guess. Breathe fire. Fly. I don't know, D. This is nuts.\"\n\nShe took a deep breath. Widened her beautiful, gray eyes. \"Look at me. Look at my eyes.\"\n\nI did. Her irises swirled. The ash gray glowed a faint yellow, then flared like a flaming red. A cloud of smoke poofed from her nose. A guttural growl emerged from deep in her belly, like last night's lasagna come up for its vengeance.\n\nInstead of bile or a vile belch, a flare of fire burst from her mouth. The candle sitting on the kitchen counter flickered to life. The electric bill sitting nearby had its edges singed.\n\nI gawked. She looked at me with those pale-again eyes.\n\n\"See? I told you,\" she said, her voice raspier than normal, like a smoker's voice.\n\nI opened my mouth to respond, closed it again, then shook my head. \"Yeah,\" I said, \"You did. Although this really just brings up more questions... I mean, how much haven't you told me? Are your parents dragons? Are they even dead? Have you just not wanted me to meet them? Are you--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, no. I'd love for you to meet them, but they really are dead.\"\n\n\"Not from a home invasion, I imagine. Considering they were dragons, too.\"\n\n\"Technically a home invasion,\" D said, treading again truth's thin line. \"The cave was their home. And there was an invasion. It just wasn't with guns or anything. There were torches and spears and two dozen knights and my parents died protecting me. I escaped into the mountains.\"\n\n\"Which mountains, truly?\"\n\n\"The Austrian Alps. I'm from Austria, like I told you. I really don't like lying to you, babe, I just couldn't come out and say I was a dragon...\"\n\n\"Well, you could have,\" I argued, but I didn't believe it myself. I hadn't come out on the first date telling her I liked pineapple on my pizza and that I took my cereal with orange juice. People just didn't share those things.\n\n\"No, babe. I couldn't have. Nobody dates dragons. People kill them. That's why I took this human form. It was either that or dying like the rest of my kind,\" D said quietly.\n\nI swallowed hard at the dampness that formed in her eyes. It hurt my heart to see her cry, hurt it worse to think of the centuries of pain she must have endured.\n\n\"So am I really your first? Or have there been hundreds before me? I've heard dragons live centuries.\"\n\n\"I told you, babe, I don't like lying to you. You really are my first. I, uh...\" She hung her head. A tear rolled down her cheek, steaming against her warm skin until it disappeared.\n\nI scooted closer, put my hand on her leg for comfort. \"Hey, you can talk to me. We're married. 'Til death do us part, all that. Dragon or not, it won't change my mind. I love you for who you are.\"\n\n\"I waited to find somebody until I knew I didn't have long left. I didn't want to fall in love, then have my love die, and then have to suffer hundreds more years alone.\"\n\n\"You don't have long left?\" The breath caught in my throat. It was my turn to pale, my turn to be comforted by her touch.\n\nShe put her hand upon mine, let the cool smoothness of her skin calm me. Scaly smoothness? I shuddered, unsure how to feel.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" she said. \"I didn't mean it like that. I don't have long left in dragon years. In human years, I'm fine. I'll probably still outlive you by a couple decades.\"\n\n\"Is that a threat?\" I said, and both our faces broke into smiles at the familiar inside joke. She rolled her eyes at me. I had more questions despite the laughs. \"What does this mean for us, D?\"\n\n\"What do you mean? We're really rich now that you know about this. I don't like parting with my hoard, but I'd be willing to if it'd help pay off those student loans of yours or the house.\"\n\nI raised my eyebrows. Getting those loans off my shoulders would be a massive relief. But the load would just be replaced by knowing my wife was a dragon.\n\n\"And the hoard is bigger than just that,\" D said, and she sat up straighter with pride.\n\n\"Really? Wow. But like, in the future, can we still have kids?\"\n\n\"Of course we can, babe. I wouldn't lie to you about that.\"\n\n\"And they'll be...\" Normal? I didn't say that. It'd break her heart.\n\n\"Part dragon,\" D said. \"But they'll fit in just fine. Just like I have. There's just one little catch, and it's more a personal preference.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me you don't want kids now,\" I said, my voice low and cautious.\n\n\"Oh, I do. But I'll need to deliver them here at home.\"\n\n\"Well, my mom delivers babies for a living so I'm sure that's no problem.\"\n\n\"Oh, she can't be here either,\" D said.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nD turned a bright shade of red and bit her lip. \"I don't want her to think I'm a freak of nature.\"\n\n\"Why would she?\" I asked, furrowing my brow.\n\n\"From what I know, the delivery won't be altogether normal. I'm pretty sure our kids will come from eggs.\"\n\n*****\n\nThanks for reading! If you enjoyed this, please check out more stories at r/MatiWrites.

              "selftext": "So i’ve been following The Odin Project for some time now and noticed that there are quite a lot of small web app projects to build in each module before ultimately getting to the capstone project where you begin working on a portfolio ready full-stack web app using MERN for example. I find that it takes me about 10-20hrs to complete one of these toy projects without using tutorials for what should be simple things like “tic-tac-toe” or “calculator”. I’m wondering if it would be better spent to just dive deep into learning the MERN stack via Odin, FCC, Udemy and just work on a full-scale project instead of spending time on the small building block projects. I don’t necessarily want to take any shortcuts on my path to dev but I’m wondering if diving deep into a big project like this could help accelerate my learning? My goal is to be employable sooner rather than later obviously but I don’t want to be out of a job in a month because I didn’t double-down on creating small projects with each new technology/concept that I learn.\n\nTLDR: Should I stick to building small web apps to build up my skillset or should I just skip those and work on a MERN app?"

For example, if you always use a MySql database and need authentication, you are probably going to build it the same way every time. Is there any way to use many prebuilt components for, for example, authentication, or having a profile page, etc.?\n\n\nThis might sound kind of vague, but I am at the brink of starting a large new project which has similar functionality to DeviantArt, which is an online community where people can upload pieces of art to their profile, which other people can then see. For this project, I would need authentication, a profile page, a way to sophisticatedly store high-quality images, etc. It seems to me that these things have been built for so many times that I would not have to code and structure these things myself. Wordpress has a lot of functionality, but it feels like it completely locks up any system that is not similar to a system that has been built before.\n\nRight now, I would make the frontend in React, use a MySql database, use Passportjs for authentication and just structure everything in the MySql database and do many API calls through Axios. I haven't thought of a way to store the images without taking up huge amounts of space on the server. Is there any obvious improvement on this way of doing things?"

However, Jellyfin identified the series as some random show on the Food Network, which it most certainly has nothing to do with this web series.\n\nI've gone through and tried to strip out all the metadata and replace it with my own. From the series main page, I've edited the title, sort title, the overview and more. For the most part it seems right. If you go to TV Shows, it's shows up as \"Name of Series\", but if you click on a season, suddenly the naming changes to the Food Network show. Yet, if I click Edit Metadata on the Season or even the individual episodes, they all show as \"Name of Series\", not the Food Network. I've literally clicked on every episode to see if some random metadata was wrong, but nope, the Food Network show appears nowhere else, but there it remains at the top of the page \"Food Network\". Furthermore, if I watch an episode and pause, in the Continue Watching section, the background image is of two fucking chefs! Yet, I have gone through every Season, every episode, and no where in Edit Images do I find this backdrop of two chefs.\n\nI just can't figure out how to make this appear as I want and to strip it of any memory of this damn Food Network show."

Example below:\n\n    const HelloWorld: React.FC<Iprops> = ({name}) => <div>`hi ${name}`</div>\n\nvs\n\n    function HelloWorld({name}: Iprops): JSX.Element {\n         return (<div>`hi ${name}`</div>)\n    }\n\n\nI get it that React.FC is returning a ReactElement, but isn't JSX.Element also just a ReactElement without types? There would be no functional or performance difference between the two approaches correct? are there any pitfalls of using one over the other?"

              "selftext": "It's very common for me to see a web designer reimplement an existing type of control, such as a checkbox or a button. Usually, this means using a span element or similar, assigning an ID and a JS event, and changing the visual style. I can only guess at why it's so common, but my assumption is that it's easier to restyle a \"fake\" button than it is to remove the default style and add something new, and that idea has become so pervasive that people just create these by default without really thinking about whether it's actually a button or a checkbox or a link. Aside from not adding basic alt-text to meaningful graphics (possibly including links and buttons), this is the single most common issue I deal with as a screen-reader user on the web.\n\nThe reason this design choice is a problem is mostly because of the assumption that a control which is clickable with a mouse and has a visually obvious function is good enough. The reality is that these controls--which are not really controls at all--are rendered to a screen-reader as nothing more than pieces of text. under certain conditions, the screen-reader can tell that they are clickable, but not much else. Depending on several factors, the screen-reader may be able to figure out how to activate them, or I may have to simulate a mouse click. If it's a checkbox, a multi-select list, or anything else where the items dynamically change colour to indicate whether they're selected, that change won't be indicated to the screen-reader (although I technically have a hotkey that tells me what colour something is.) The consequences of this can be anything from not knowing whether I've agreed to the terms and conditions to not knowing whether I chose to remove a sandwich ingredient I'm deathly allergic to. Some users prefer the keyboard even when they don't use a screen-reader, and using non-standard controls takes away their ability to use keyboard commands such as tab and space to move to and activate buttons.\n\nOne of the most popular poll plugins for Wordpress doesn't present the options as radio buttons. The other one does, but it shows a chart of results that has no alt-text. The numbers are right there, but they're automagically turned into an inaccessible graphic, and what Wordpress user is going to think of changing that? So it's not just content creators; it's also the people who make it possible for us to create content. Wordpress administrators won't know better, and will put out countless polls that will be inaccessible in some way. This is just one of an exhaustingly large list of examples.\n\nThere is a way to create accessible controls without actually using that control type, using [ARIA roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles). These essentially trick the screen-reader into seeing an element as something it's not, similar to styling a plain piece of text to visually look like something it's not. This is often what we do to existing projects in order to avoid breaking compatibility.\n\nI don't know if anyone on this subreddit actually needs to hear this. and if there is a practical application for doing this, I'd love to know what it is. Right now, it looks like a lot of people just don't want to use standard controls or don't really think about what they're designing.\n\nLastly, I want to say that whenever I post something like this, I get a lot more people who do go the extra mile than people who don't. And realistically, that is reflected in my usage of the web. A lot of websites are great, and are only improving. Most developers care and want to make things better; they just don't have the time or knowledge or their company hasn't even informed them there is a problem despite customer service insisting they've forwarded my feedback to the developers. I regard this as a newbie mistake, not a malicious coding practice that all the big bad developers do just to piss me off. Nevertheless, I don't know how to spread the word that this is bad--and the word needs to be spread. So for those who have done literally anything at all to make your content more accessible: Thank you. You deserve an entirely separate post. I know it's not always easy, but these tiny nitpicky details are often the most common, and those usually *are* easy."

I am less sure that React and Gatsby belong in this space. \n\nWe're serving static HTML with a little bit of fanciness here and there, but only cosmetic fanciness - front end JS stuff. It seems to me that if we weren;t loading React in the first place and instead just pushing the data through something like Pug for templating plus Vue for anything dynamic that we would have a much simpler codebase that likely produced faster pages.\n\nI am wondering whether other folks are confronting this dilemma and what considerations might guide me toward one solution versus another. Headless CMS is the only piece of the puzzle that is non negotiable. Everything else is up for grabs.\n\nI am having trouble deciding if I am being an old fart or if React really isn't the panacea to all web problems that it seems to be right now. I am even less sure about Gatsby, which has an ecosystem I don't love and seems to want me to not use image or anchor tags which is insane and silly at the same time.\n\nSo I am hoping some of you young whippersnapper devs can tell me why I am wrong, or what matrix you use to choose your tooling when the product is more on the website side of the app/website spectrum."

              "selftext": "I love learning languages and I am currently on my 5th language, German. I speak English, French, Mandarin and Spanish and after German, I plan on learning Italian and Portuguese.\n\nHere are 10 tips I have for language learners that I have found helpful in my own language learning journey:\n\n**Speaking**\n\nTip #1: Find native speakers to chat with through apps like HELLOTALK and TANDEM. I've made many friends all over the world through these language exchange apps and have had a chance to meet quite a few of them in real life. You may need to do some filtering on these apps though, because like with any social media apps, you're going to come across creeps who aren't there for the intended purpose of the app. But with some patience, you'll be able to make those quality connections to help your language learning as well as to build long-lasting friendships. If you are a shy person or don't like to talk to strangers online, just remember that you're completely anonymous and if you don't want to continue talking with someone, you have every right to leave the conversation.\n\nTip #2: Look on [MEETUP.com](https://meetups.com/) for language exchange groups in your area. Many cities have a MUNDOLINGO group where you just show up, tape some flag stickers on your shirt in descending order of your language proficiencies and walk around and converse with people who have flags of the languages you want to practice. It's a very friendly environment and especially if you're new to a city, it's a great way to meet new people.\n\n**Listening**\n\nTip #3: I love the COFFEE BREAK LANGUAGE podcasts and I'm currently listening through the German series. They offer French, Spanish, Mandarin, German, Italian, English and Swedish podcasts at the moment. It takes you from basic grammar to more intermediate level conversations and the lessons are fun and applicable. Other ways to improve your listening is simply to listen to podcasts in your target language. CASTBOX is a great app for free podcasts.\n\nTip #4: If you have NETFLIX, you can turn your binge-watching into a language learning experience with two Google Chrome Extensions. NFLXMULTISUBS is an extension that allows you to turn on subtitles of two languages at the same time and LANGUAGE LEARNING WITH NETFLIX gives you a fully translated dialogue on the side of the screen as well as auto-pause after every sentence to give you time to learn some new vocabulary/phrases before moving on. If you want to access Netflix shows/movies from a different country, you can install a VPN (I would recommend ExpressVPN) and change your location to another country to watch its shows/movies.\n\n**Reading**\n\nTip #5: If you are at an intermediate/advanced level, try reading the news or novels in the target language. I like to re-read novels I've already read in English because I already know the plot and it makes it a lot easier to understand in a different language. The Harry Potter series is a great series to do this exercise.\n\nTip #6: If you are a beginner, you can try an app called BEELINGUA which has bilingual short stories. Your screen will be split into two, one language on top and another on the bottom, and when you don't understand a phrase, simply highlight it and it will highlight the same section in the other language. Reading children stories is generally a good idea to pick up new and commonly used vocabulary and phrases.\n\n**Writing**\n\nTip #7: Write a daily journal in your target language (maybe 10 minutes a day) about what you did that day, what you learned and what's on your mind. I found this exercise very helpful because you are training your brain to think in the target language. You'll also find that there are many words you don't know or thoughts you can't express in the target language, so this gives you a chance to look up those words/phrases and learn them. When I was learning Spanish last year and traveling in Australia/New Zealand, I decided to write my travel journal in Spanish. Although it was extremely challenging, I learned a lot of new vocabulary and phrases just from translating words and sentences that I didn't know. Even though the grammar was nowhere near perfect, it at least gets you in the mindset of thinking in a different language and trying to express yourself through writing in that language.\n\n**Vocabulary**\n\nTip #8: You may be asking, \"so what do I do with all this new vocabulary and phrases that I've accumulated through the previous 7 tips?\" I would recommend an app called ANKIDROID which allows you to create your own flashcards. It's very simple to use and you can put all your new vocabulary and phrases there and do some memory practices every day.\n\n**Grammar**\n\nTip #9: There are many free grammar textbooks online that you can download and do exercises in. If you would like some grammar books in Spanish or German, feel free to send me a message and I can email them to you.\n\nTip #10: Lastly, I recommend BABBEL for learning basic grammar of a language. It's an excellent and simple website that takes you through the beginner to intermediate levels of a language with practical exercises that put the grammar to use through conversations. BABBEL is the only recommendation in this post that is paid, but if you want to try a free month of BABBEL, send me a message and I can send you a referral :)\n\n**Bonus tip for those who know multiple languages:** As you learn a new language, learn it through the lens of another language you already know. For example, I'm currently learning German through French on Babbel, so as I'm learning German, I'm also reviewing my French at the same time.\n\nI hope you've found some of these tips helpful! Let me know which ones you've already tried and which ones you've liked or disliked. I would love to hear your tips for language learning as well!\n\nEdit: If you want to try Babbel for a month for free, you can use this link: [https://www.talkable.com/x/djAyBX](https://www.talkable.com/x/djAyBX)"

              "selftext": "[MPV Shim](https://github.com/iwalton3/jellyfin-mpv-shim) has been fulfilling to develop and I will continue to maintain it. However, I have less time and there is more work to be done on it. With over 4,600 downloads over the past month, I want to help ensure the software is optimal for as many users as possible!\n\nThe software is written in multi-threaded, synchronous Python 3 code, with distribution via pypi, flatpak, and pyinstaller (for Windows). Pull requests are welcome, I will continue to handle code review and releases. You can read more details about the [software implementation here](https://github.com/iwalton3/jellyfin-mpv-shim/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). I am also available on the matrix chat (username iwalton3) during evenings and weekends if anyone has questions about the code.\n\nAreas that could use help:\n\n\\- SyncPlay Support - While I can implement this, I don't think I'll have enough time to implement it before the 10.6 release.\n\n\\- Better OSX Support - Currently OSX has partial support, relying on manual installation.\n\n\\- Translation - Currently the software is English-only and does not implement localization at all. I know I have users speaking Chinese, French, and Spanish.\n\n\\- Improved Web Client Integration - Currently the web client is integrated [with a patch](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web/compare/master...iwalton3:master) that send requests back to MPV Shim and still uses Play To instead of a direct connection.\n\n\\- General Issues - There are a [number of issues](https://github.com/iwalton3/jellyfin-mpv-shim/issues) that also need work.\n\n\\- Any other cleanup. For instance, being able to [terminate MPV while unused](https://github.com/iwalton3/jellyfin-mpv-shim/issues/66)."

It got many interested and since then more than 50 genres have been added, as well as descriptions for every genre.\n\nI'm making this post to thank those following already, and am once again open for suggestions and ideas. I also made a subreddit called [r/TheAmazingSounds](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAmazingSounds/) where you can post about music that you want to share with others. It is currently empty but I will try to keep it active and reply often.\n\nYou can find everything on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/21ccavqrh37bmu2mode4wyzdi?si=-ev0TYGESCu-UczeDxJbrQ). It is synced with other services but doesn't convert all songs.\n\n[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/21ccavqrh37bmu2mode4wyzdi?si=-ev0TYGESCu-UczeDxJbrQ) | [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/profile/2236084444/playlists) | [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/timothy-walschaerts/sets) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPmDHX0C6i2ix9N49yavAzw/playlists?view_as=subscriber)"

The next day he returned.\n\nElder gent: ”The printer isn’t working!”\n\nMy friend: ”Have you connected the power supply?”\n\nElder gent: “Yes!”\n\nMy friend: ”Have you connected the other cable to your PC?”\n\nElder gent: “PC? I don’t own a PC, I only want to print!”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce I visited a woman: Her PC lost the internet connection and the printer wasn’t working. When I was crawling under the office desk she said in German “Ich hatte noch nie einen Professionellen in meinem Haus.” Translation: ”I have never had a professional in my house.” I jumped up and hit my head very hard. You are asking me why?\n\nWell, when you talk in Germany about a professional worker, we just say “Profi” or \"Experte\". The term “Professioneller” is only used for male sex workers.\n\nEdit 1: Typo\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for your great stories and your questions. I will follow up, I promise. But here the sun is set and I have to go to bed... Oh: and thank you for my first award. CU\n\nEdit 3: I will have a lot of reading to do this weekend. Thank you! Some people were asking about the ending of the third story: I got up, holding my head and turned around. The woman was standing there eyes wide open and with both hands in front of her mouth. There was awkward laughter from both of us until I left the house. You were hoping for some erotic content? Let’s be frank: 20 years ago times were easier, but everytime I lost my professionalism and followed the temptation I got in serious trouble, sooner or later.\n\nEdit 4: A few users mentioned:  [r/talesfromtechsupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/)\n\nEdit 5: Thanks to everybody for your fine stories. It's midnight in Germany and I read every single post. Thanks again, that was fun."

It seems that WebSocket based (or something similarly stateful) should have become an accepted use by now, but I don’t see it the proliferation. \n\nI get that there’s a cost to keeping a WebSocket alive, but it must be very small, no? With something more WS based, your web / mobile app can instantly request the data it needs and get back only that. \n\nApps (web and mobile) are increasing dependent on state - in fact a core React hook is called useState. So I’m curious why more isn’t being done to promote stateful backend interfaces. \n\nThanks."

There are obviously a lot of different ways to do this.\n\n* SVGs or fonts allow for custom coloring and resolution native rendering\n* PNGs or SVGs with CSS filters\n\n[Amazon's solution](https://i.imgur.com/9UHiSib.png)\n\nThe way Amazon solved it at surface level looks pretty standard: They have a PNG spritesheet for a bunch of icons on the website, including the stars. However, instead of having one sprite for each combination of stars (10 different combinations in total), they use a moving window on two lines of stars. One line has the cutoff at the full star, whereas the other one has the cutoff at a half filled star. These two sprites can be used for every combination of rating by just moving the window.\n\nImplemented easily with a div with a PNG background and use background-position to move the window.\n\nSo yeah, I ended up borrowing this idea for our website. Super low bandwidth need, high performance for showing many products, and backwards compatibility.\n\nEdit: A lot of people have been pointing out that spritesheets are not anything genius but rather legacy stuff. I am fully aware! But in this kind of use, they are still the best option taking all perspectives into account."

The image size fluctuates over the next few hours (69%, 72%, etc.) so a ton of alarms go off. I believe the \"Container\" and \"Writeable\" are growing quickly due to Plex traffic but am not sure that is the only problem and want to understand all my applications a bit more. I am not interested in increasing the docker image size or changing when the alarms go off, I want to understand which applications are consuming the space and why.\n\nI have analyzed all my active docker containers and added a max log setting where applicable, when the log became large (>50mb), so I don't believe runaway logs are the problem: \n\n`--log-opt max-size=50m --log-opt max-file=1`\n\nI know I can get a current snapshot of my docker usage by clicking the \"Container Size\" button on the /Docker page but that is only a current snapshot and it isn't fast enough or historical. I was thinking about collecting this data and placing it into a time series DB (InfluxDB or Prometheus) and graphing it (Grafana).\n\nI am most familiar with Prometheus but am not surer how to collect the data from:\n\n`/mnt/user/system/docker/docker.img`\n\nAny tips? Is this the best way to get this information/solve this problem?

              "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI worked at AWS as a software engineer for a few years. I've noticed some interesting things since leaving:\n\n* People who want to deploy websites/apps/pages are really, really daunted by AWS.\n* Trying to find AWS tutorials online is just awful. It feels like everything is either a manual, a \"12 hour certification course\" or an outdated Medium article from 2016. \n* Many people are using Netlify, which is really just a wrapper around AWS, and similar \"instantly deploy services\".\n\nI've recently helped some friends in the startup world set things up on AWS - mostly deploying static sites. So far, all of them are now \n\n* spending less money on hosting\n* getting better load time on their sites\n* deploying things pretty much as quickly as Netlify's offering\n\nI'm thinking of writing up some friendly resources/tutorials on using AWS so others can have these benefits too.\n\nWould you guys be interested in this? \n\nIf so, **please let me know what kind of tutorial you'd like to see.** It'll help me decide on the best tutorials to start with. For example, it could be \"deploying a static site on S3 + CloudFront\".\n\n**EDIT:** Wow I didn't expect this much attention! I'm trying my best to note down all the info from your comments and messages, but it'd be a huge help if you could also answer in this form I setup quickly: https://forms.gle/SFTuigCBeupeReV2A.\n\nFilling that out will also make it easier for me to distribute tutorials I create to you guys.\n\n**EDIT 2:** \nI've been combing through all of your responses and have started preparing a roadmap of tutorial topics, which I'll communicate soon!\n\nFrom what you've all said, it looks like Youtube and blog posts/articles are the best ways to provide these tutorials to you guys.\n\nI've setup some pages which I'll use to post tutorials if you'd like to subscribe to them in the meantime:\n\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuKP0tNM7tWR8EAOdr4utOw)\n- [Medium](https://medium.com/@awstutorials)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/awstutorials_io)\n\nI'll also put up a website (which will include blog posts) real soon! I think that'll be a great way of collating all the channels and resources into one place.\n\nIf you think I've missed a distribution channel or anything else, please feel free to DM me!\n\nLastly, if you signed up on the Google Form, I'll be reaching out soon with updates!\n\nThanks everyone :)"

I'm not talking about NextJS or Gatsby, but more about using a templating language.\n\nI would only use client side rendering if the website requires interactivity.\n\nAre we victim of the mainstream way of doing things, following tutorials on Medium that praise the usage of the cool latest technologies?"

I would read an article talking about using Promises with Fetch API I would get it in that context but I kept wondering about the situation I would create a Promise for my code.\n\nI must mention I also had a very poor understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, so I was set up to fail. Learning more about asynchronous programming lead me to callbacks which gave me an aha moment, the light bulb went on. I finally understood the hype about Promises and Async/Await.\n\nIn this article, We are going to take a look at the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript. We will then proceed to learn about the importance of callbacks, creating callbacks, and finally, we will cover about callback hell.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will understand:\n\n- Synchronous and asynchronous behavior in JavaScript\n- Why and when callbacks are needed\n- How to create callbacks.\n- Callback hell\n\nI believe the knowledge you will gain from reading this tutorial will be an invaluable prerequisite to learning Promises and Async/Await.\n\nLink to the full article: [https://www.stanleyulili.com/javascript/asynchronous-programming-with-callbacks-in-javascript/](https://www.stanleyulili.com/javascript/asynchronous-programming-with-callbacks-in-javascript/)"

              "selftext": "Hello data hoarders! I made a very simple website (barely any css) where you can submit your youtube-dl archive files along with a contact email or reddit account, so if anyone searches that video ID later if the video has been deleted, they can contact you asking you kindly for a copy of that video. I'm working on a solution that can auto notify users if any videos they've reported as having are deleted or privated. \n\nhttps://archivr.tk\n\nExample search: https://archivr.tk/search.php?id=test\n\nFor now, if you want to submit your file, I wrote a quick and dirty console application that goes line by line bottom up through a text file you give it and submits it to my site. (https://github.com/matt1tk/archivr-uploader) I have been looking for a quicker way to do it, because currently it is kinda slow. About 100 lines in 15 seconds on my PC. I'm working on making a faster submit system (for now just run it every week or two, i'll remove duplicates every so often). An online form wouldn't work as some are hundreds of thousands of lines. If you have any problems with submitting, feel free to PM me your archive file and what you want in the contact field and I will submit it myself.\n\nAs of right now, the only info that gets stored in the database is the video site (youtube in most cases), the video ID, the contact info you enter, the current date, and an hash of the IP that gets reported. This is to avoid abuse, so I can easily remove any row where the IP matches the hash.\n\nThe database is not public, you can only search by an entire video ID, so that should mitigate any data mining attacks that looks at your youtube video downloads.\n\nNow to the application that submits your file (https://github.com/matt1tk/archivr-uploader) : When you run it the first time, it will ask for the file path of your file and the contact info. It will save these to a file called config.txt. Any subsequent run will pull the info from config.txt. The program will run from the bottom up from the text file, which means the program needs to load the entire text file into memory to flip it. This should be no problem, unless you have very little ram and a 100MB+ large archive file. It starts from the bottom up to allow the program to start with the video ID's that have been added recently. I don't care if you run it the whole way through each time, it will probably result in duplicates but those can be removed in the SQL database. You can place the exe right in the same directory as it and just type in \"youtube-dl-archive.txt\" instead of the whole path.\n\nSorry for writing such a large post, hope you use this site, and let me know if you have any questions or contributions!\n\nEdit: I’ve completely rewritten the submission system. It now doesn’t require any sort of installation. I’m working on patching out some bugs but i’ll make a new post once I get everything 100% working.\n\nEdit 2: The submission system is complete. https://archivr.tk/upload.html"

Also, how do I connect to that server and use Pihole, when Pihole is in one of the docker containers? Strictly using the server local IP(192.168.X.X) will not work I guess?\n7. This whole network WILL NOT be accesible from the internet. Only my owm VPN will be directly connected to my local network and thats it. \n\nGoal is to be able to access any of the services from any of my local devices and also use pihole on all of the local devices. Thanks for info!"

So as part of my preparation process, I went through many interview question sources as well as the ReactJS/Redux official documentation to put together a cheat sheet for the questions and topics I saw repeatedly. Answers to questions are in bullet form with further in-depth readings cited as part of each question. I hope this helps those that are preparing or need a refresher! \n\nPlease note that questions are meant to cover basics and fundamentals. I did my best to be as unopinionated as possible citing exact areas of the documentation where I paraphrased from. I've linked in the bottom my primary sources for interview questions, many of them being the cream of the crop of interview questions that I've come across. If you see anywhere that I made a mistake or could use improvement, please let me know! Thank you."

New content below. \n---------------------------\n\nOracle (Cloud). These certs all not that useful, but hey, I'll basically take anything when it's free. You can take each exam once. Must complete all tests by 5/15/20. \n\nUpdate: I'm not able to see open exam slots for most of these anymore. It's unlikely you will be able to register for an Oracle exam at this point. Seems they’re booked up. \n\nFree exams available (on Pearson Vue): \n\nOracle Autonomous Database Specialist  \nOracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Associate  \nOracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Operations Associate  \nOracle Cloud Infrastructure Developer Associate\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect Associate\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect Professional\n\nMore info, and links to register:\nhttps://www.oracle.com/corporate/blog/free-certifications-oracle-oci-autonomous-033020.html\n\nAll multiple choice exams. \n\n---------------------------\n\nJuniper Networks. Juniper's \"Open Learning\" program always allows you to earn free associate level exam certs (one time per track; there's 5 tracks). JNCIA-Junos is the hardest to get access to as it requires enrolling in a web course to earn the voucher. \n\nYou can earn the other ones (JNCDA, JNCIA-Cloud, etc) through Junos Genius. You do have to complete the exam within 3 months of earning the free voucher. No rush on this in general though it's been available for a couple years now. Earning a JNCIA cert automatically extends expiration on all other JNCIA Juniper certs you have. So good to space these out over a few years. Multiple choice. Pearson Vue. \n\nHere's direct links to the Juniper options:\n\nJNCIA-JUNOS: This one requires a special registration session and is capacity controlled. You can sign up for the 10/2020 session here while spaces are still open: https://learningportal.juniper.net/juniper/user_activity_info.aspx?id=10175\nAll current sessions are full up. Once you register the content will unlock in Junos Genius and you can earn the voucher.

Well, it's as friendly as I could make it, given the nature of the app.\n\nIt's taken me about around month to build as I worked through Stephen Grider's and Tyler McGinnis's React courses. \n\nA brief write-up is on github, as well as a guide to using the thing: https://github.com/psychedelicious/lifelike\n\nI greatly appreciate any critical feedback on the design or code. I know I have huge room for improvement in both areas. Suggestions and feedback for the app itself are also appreciated, of course! \n\nThank you for taking the time to use and/or review the app!"

Everything went well until he said following at [32:40](https://youtu.be/35lXWvCuM8o?t=1960)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>the problem is every time we updates the code in our use context (I think he meant updating the state) all the components that uses this context are gonna re render\n\nI don't get what he mean by that. Isn't that why we used `state` as context value. He mentioned `redux` as the better solution in the beginning of this video. Does that mean `redux` already have solved what ever the problem he is saying?"

They want something that does what they need. \n\nWhere can I learn about the formats of sites used for different purposes? I get that widgets like a mailing list signup, phone number, and contact form have their place on certain pages, but where is that place? Should I be using flashy red and yellow and pressure-inducing phrasing like \"get your free quote now!\" or is that too much? One page site with horizontal sections or multi-page with standard brochure site sections?\n\nI don't expect answers to these since they'll depend on the project, but I'd like somewhere to learn how to decide what is appropriate for which types of projects."

              "selftext": "Environmental variables [have been around since DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#DOS). They can make your (and my) life easier.\n\nNot every system uses C as the main drive.  Some enterprises use folder redirection, and relocates the Documents folder.  *Some places in the world don't speak English and their directories reflect that.* Use those environmental variables to make your programs \"just work\".\n\n* `%SystemDrive%` is the drive where `%SystemRoot%` is located. You most likely don't need to actually know this\n* `%SystemRoot%` is where the Windows directory is located.  You hopefully don't care about this.  Leave the Windows directory alone.\n* `%ProgramFiles%` is where you should place your program files, preferable in a Company\\\\Program structure\n* `%ProgramFiles(x86)%` is where you should place your 32-bit program files. Please update them for 64-bit.  32-bit will eventually be unsupported, and business will be waiting for you to get your shit together for far longer than necessary\n* `%ProgramData%` is where you should store data that isn't user specific~~, but still needs to be written to by users~~ (Users don't have write access to this folder either).  Your program shouldn't require administrator rights to run as you shouldn't have us writing to the `%ProgramFiles%` directory.  Also, don't throw executables in here.\n* `%Temp%` is where you can process temporary data.  Place that data within a unique folder name (maybe a generated GUID perhaps) so you don't cause an incompatibility with another program.  Windows will even do the cleanup for you.  Don't put temporary data in in `%ProgramData%` or `%ProgramFiles%`.\n* `%AppData%` is where you can save the user running your program settings.  This is a fantastic location that can by synced with a server and used to quickly and easily migrate a user to a new machine and keep all of their program settings.  Don't put giant or ephemeral files here.  You could be the cause of a very slow login if you put the wrong stuff here and a machine needs to sync it up. *DON'T PUT YOUR PROGRAM FILES HERE. The business decides what software is allowed to run, not you and a bunch of users who may not know how their company's environment is set up.*\n* `%LocalAppData%` is where you can put bigger files that are specific to a user and computer.  You don't need to sync up a thumbnail cache.  They won't be transferred when a user migrates to a new machine, or logs into a new VDI station, or terminal server. *DON'T PUT YOUR PROGRAM FILES HERE EITHER.*\n\nYou can get these through [API calls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/known-folders) as well if you don't/can't use environmental variables.\n\nUse the [Windows Event Log](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-logging) for logging.  It'll handle the rotation for you and a sysadmin can forward those logs or do whatever they need to.  You can even make your own little area just for your program.\n\nUse [documented Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/system-error-codes) when exiting your program.\n\nDistribute your program in MSI (or now [probably MSIX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/overview)).  It is the standard for Windows installation files (even though Microsoft sometimes doesn't use it themselves).\n\n[Sign your installation file and executables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/appxpkg/how-to-sign-a-package-using-signtool). *It's how we know it's valid and can whitelist in AppLocker or other policies.*\n\nEdit: some more since I've had another drink\n\nWant to have your application update for you? That can be fine if the business is okay with it. You can create a scheduled task or service that runs elevated to allow for this without granting the user admin rights. I like the way Chrome *Enterprise* does it: gives a GPO to set update settings, the max version it will update to (say 81.\\* to allow all minor updates automatically and major versions are manual), and a service. *They also have a GPO to prevent user-based installs.*\n\nUse [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) (should go in the version property in the installer file and in the Add/Remove Programs list, not in the application title) and have a [changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). You can also have your installer download at a predictable location to allow for automation. A published update path is nice too.\n\nADMX templates are dope.\n\nUSB license dongles are a sin. Use a regular software or network license. I'm sure there are off the shelf ones so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\nDon't use that damn custom IPv4 input field. Use FDQNs. IPv6 had been around since 1998 and will work with your software if you just give it a chance.\n\nThe Windows Firewall (can't really say much about third party ones) is going to stay on. Know the difference between an incoming and outgoing rule. Most likely, your server will need incoming. Most likely, you clients won't even need an outgoing. Set those up at install time, not launch time. Use Firewall Groups so it's easy to filter. Don't use Any rules if you can help it. The goal isn't to make it work, it's to make it work securely. If you don't use version numbers in your install path, you might not even have to remake those rules after every upgrade."

Every once in a while, I revamp the whole thing using new technologies so that I keep myself updated with the latest and greatest, and also gives me a creative outlet to experiment with new design ideas.\n\nThis year, I kicked it up a notch by revamping the design of the old boring two-column resume look, to something a lot more vibrant, responsive and effective. I'll keep my words to a minimum and let the website do the talking :)\n\n**Introducing, the brand-new, Resume on the Web:**   \n**https://amruthpillai.com/**\n\nFor those who want the technical deets, this version is built with GatsbyJS, a static-site React framework that I wanted to explore recently, as well as Tailwind CSS for the uber-cool utility classes.\n\nAs always, the source code for the project is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/AmruthPillai/ResumeOnTheWeb-Gatsby\n\nPlease do let me know if you liked it as much as I enjoyed making it! :)"

They offer all their guides in PDF format, which I thought might be easier for viewing and self-containment then HTML.\n\nI've downloaded all their guides as PDFs, and put them into a single torrent. I think this is information that is very valuable to have offline - for power outages, remote travel/backpacking, the end of the world, etc. I'm hoping this can join some of your collections, beside Wikipedia and first aid pamphlets.\n\nMagnet link:\n\n    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ed9889445d52d7882e844bd926e1b547a2c00781&dn=pdfs.zip&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fp4p.arenabg.com%3A1337%2Fannounce\n\n[Torrent file](https://archive.org/download/ifixit-pdfs-2020-04/pdfs.torrent)\n\nThe torrent is just a single ZIP file named `pdfs.zip`, that contains all the guides. It is about 60 gigabytes in total. Each guide is named by the name of the guide, for easy searching. Duplicate names were fixed by adding numbers to the end, as in `guide name [2].pdf` and `guide name [3].pdf`. All filenames are Windows safe.\n\nKeep in mind that my upload speeds are slow, and it may take a bit for your computer to find mine. But I have always-on server that is seeding it, so it will download eventually.\n\nThe contents of the torrent will also be up on the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/ifixit-pdfs-2020-04), they are downloading it now. If you want to replicate what I've done, or update the archive yourself (I will try and update it every so often), there are wget and python3 scripts and source files (like lists of urls) in that archive as well. Those files are not part of the torrent.\n\nIf you have any questions, or plan on seeding, let me know below!\n\nEDIT: As I mentioned above, my upload speed is slow. The torrent will take a very long time initially, and there's not much I can do about that. Feel free to come back in a couple days when there will be more than just me with a full copy."

It had a link to another site about 15 miles down the road. \n\nFor some reason when spring rolled around though, every day at 12:00 exactly the T-1 uplink would fail. \n\nDid I mention this site was rural?\n\nSince there was no uplink, the site could not be troubleshot remotely so I would have to drive the 100 or so miles to the site from our central office.\n\nInvariably though the site would be running again by the time I got there!\n\nAfter about the third try, I made an early trip down there to be on site at noon to see what was happening. Sure enough 12 rolls around and down it goes.\n\nBut nothing is wrong with the hardware at all! \n\nAfter another few days of four hours of windshield time and all the frustration I could stomach, I finally convinced the site engineer to come out with me. He was just as befuddled as I was until he climbed up the mast with a pair of binoculars to check the line of site.\n\n\"So THATS what it is\" he says. \n\nWhat was happening was an almond farm directly between our two sites lit off their irrigation sprinklers every day at noon sharp. The change in humidity and air temp was JUUUUUST enough to bend the microwave line of site so the link would drop. \n\nWe swapped out the 2GHz link for a 5GHz one and never had another problem.\n\nBut that one site definitely influenced my drinking for a while."

I always aim to get everything to work! No matter what! And when something goes bad I don't fix it, I just reinstall Windows all over again. I always search for a lightweight operating system that meets all of my weird expectations, but can't find any.\n\nThis habit is really wasting my time and my energy. It only happens with technology, phones, tablets, pc's, and especially if I am programming!\n\nI have been programming for the last 8 years! Yes 8 years! But I don't even have 1 project to showcase my skills or something to be proud of!\n\nI really need your help, what are your views on the problem? Am I the only one?

I personally really like his videos and find them entertaining, but as some of you might know, he is selling an ebook on his method of learning languages.\n\nI got the book yesterday and really wanted to see if the method works. I already have my experience in learning languages (I'm C1 english and B2 spanish) so you won't be getting the perspective of a complete beginner. I'll be learning  French (bear in mind that I'm a native portuguese speaker, which comes from the same family of languages as French) so it might be a little easier for me.\n\nThe method is quite simple. It consists of Input>Output>Refinement.\n\nInput\n\nThis stage lasts 4-8 months and consists of Pimsleur>Assimil>Glossika + Media (Tv shows and series with subtitles, songs, games...)\n\nYou will study 1 hour a day and consume 1-2 hours of media everyday. \n\nOutput \n\nThis stage lasts 2-4 months and consists of italki+language exchange+discord servers + media (without subtitles)\n\nThis stage is where you'll start speaking the language with other natives, getting feedback and learning how native speakers actually speak (instead of relying on those pre-made dialogues by the courses)\n\nIn this stage you'll hopefully be able to understand conversations, speak and watch tv without subtitles.\n\nRefinement \n\nNothing much to say here. This stage is optional but I'll do it anyways. You'll basically study more about the grammar, alphabet, writing system, vocabulary and refine your knowledge.\n\nI won't go deep down into the method. If you wanna know more, please consider buying the book and supporting the creator.\n\nWhy I think the method might work: in the input stage you'll get a good grasp on listening, speaking, pronunciation and grammar through pimsleur and assimil. I have my personal experience with these courses and I think that they are excellent for learning languages. The method also seems light and easy to be consistent with (1 hour of studying +1-2 hours of media consumption). The book's feedback on the comment section of his videos also seem pretty good and legit.\n\nCons: you'll have to buy some courses (assimil, pimsleur, glossika and pay for tutors on italki [but,you know, cof cof- pirate bay- cof cof])\n\nFor the following months I'll come to this post and update my progress if any of you want to see if the method is legit and works."

              "selftext": "So short backstory, I recently purchased a split level home. Great setup as there are not only 2 attic spaces but also a crawlspace. The home was set up for having co-axial cables in each and every room. I was able to trace back the wiring and just about everything is ran in the crawlspace and centralizes in my basement utility room which gives me extremely easy access to the cabling. So in theory, I can tape Cat5 to the co-axial, and pull it through the walls for doing ethernet in every room. \n\nWhat I would like to do is set up a new router (something with 802.11ax, trying to get my hands on an amplifi alien), 16 port switch with POE, and an access point or two to give me reliable connection throughout the house and just outside the home. \n\nI want to be able to have direct control over my internet at home as I do have a lot of smart home devices from door locks, arlo cameras, smart lights etc. After watching The Hook Up's video about ubiquiti unifi set up, that looks ideal however I have 1000mbps from AT&T, and will try to hardwire the tv's for streaming but need bandwidth for phones/iPads connecting to wifi. \n\nMy main question is, I get 1Gbps speeds at my modem from ethernet. So in theory, one router connected will receive 1Gbps from the modem and push that to a switch. The switch will receive close to that full 1Gbps and manage/push the data to the hardwired devices on the network? Does this mean my gigabit capable devices (desktop, iPad pro) can actually receive near that 1Gbps speed on multiple units at the same time? Also, would the routers wifi speed be throttled with the 16 port (planning on using about 10) switch devices? \n\nIf that is not the case, what is a good recommended set up for trying to future proof my home with 1000/1000mbps service, having a good wifi router (with AX access points) and a powerful switch for the home. I would prefer to not have to upgrade anything network wise for the next 5+ years."

I was able to swap this in at random places in one of my big projects and had it work just fine. There's a picture of that at the top of the README. There are also [examples available here.](https://andrew4699.github.io/react-see-through/#basic-usage)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is my first sizeable open-source project and **I would love feedback** on anything from feature requests to even code quality.

I can just email if we have any issues. \n\n\n>Me: No, no. I like to look them in the eye as I hand out this stuff. \n\n\nI heard the admin mutter weirdo under her breath.\n\n\nHanding out hardware has always been a fun game. I tried to sense what condition I'd next see this pristine hardware in. I handed it off to a man in a dishevelled suit. \n\n>Dishevelled:  Hey so like you're IT right? \n\nI hate that question ... Maybe I should have left. \n\n>Me: Yep.\n\n>Dishevelled: So, what kinda tracking software do they load these things up with?\n\nAs the man who couldn't be bothered to find an iron for his first day of work took the laptop off me, I realised I was never seeing that laptop again. \n\n>Me: Err... tonnes.\n\n>Dishevelled: Can I ask you to remove it. I feel its an Invasion of p^r^i^v^a^c^y.....\n\nHis speech drifted off as the manager of sales had wandered over. \n\n>SalesManager: You're a brave one, Showing your face around here. \n\n>Dishevelled: Oh. Er, sorry, I didn't. its my first ....\n\nSales Manager had cut him off. \n\n>SalesManager: Not you. Mr. IT here. \n\nDishevelled quickly collected his items and fled, much like I should have done earlier. \n\n>SalesManager: Do you know what I received on Friday?\n\n>Me: Erm... \n\n>SalesManager: Two things! First the monthly financial report.\n\nSalesmanager stood wild eyed, he paused, seemingly begging me to interrupt him. I knew never to interrupt when those wild eyes can be seen. \n\n>SalesManager: I take great pride in the financials of the sales department. As I always say, a cough in sales is sickness to the rest of the company. I could forecast the next six months worth of sales. We always hit the targets set ...\n\nWe're 5 sentences in and I stopped caring about my life. \n\n>Me: Okay. Stop. I need to set up these new employees. Your issue is best emailed. \n\nSalesManager took one of the new laptops off the desk in front of me. \n\n>SalesManager: Darn right I will email it. Imagine my surprise when I got this 30 thousand dollar bill hitting my financials for last month from IT. \n\n>Me: Okay....\n\nSalesManager pointed to the Property of BigCorp IT Department sticker on the new laptop.\n\n>SalesManager: And what does this say?\n\n>Me: That's the asset tag, Helps us track equipment. \n\n>SalesManager: IT Department!\n\nSalesManager said the words with finality.\n\n>Me: ...\n\n>SalesManager: So why the hell am I paying for your equipment?\n\n>Me: Okay, SalesManager. I will email you how the company billing process for IT works. But I really need to get back to...\n\nSalesManager was having none of it. \n\n>SalesManager: Three zero zero zero zero zero?... 30 Grand. You're joking. \n\n>Me: I will send you an itemised list of items your department purchased, but to be honest you're looking at it. \n\nI waved my hands over all the new Laptops, Docks and Screens. \n\n>SalesManager: I have the itemised list already. You know these laptops are $1500 each? They're not worth that.\n\nThe new employees looked at the fight occurring oddly. The fun glean of the first day already destroyed, as they realise who they're working under. Dishevelled heard the 1500 price tag and looked down at the laptop like gold. We're never seeing that one again. \n\n>Me: Okay SalesManager, that is the direct price from our supplier through our commercial agreement with them. I will email you the supplier invoice. \n\n>SalesManager: No way. I can google. I know how much these specs in a laptop are worth. You're probably getting a rebate or something, cash back! I work in sales I know all the tricks. Those invoices aren't worth the paper they're printed on. \n\n>Me: ... okay?\n\nSalesManager looked a little deflated that I wasn't trying to fight. It was Monday morning. Who fights on F&%$ing Monday morning\n\n>SalesManager: I want it cheaper.\n\n>Me: That's not really how this works....\n\nSalesManager stood oddly between me and his employees. I decided to just leave.\n\n>Me: MeanAdmin you got it from here? I better go back to IT department. \n\n>SalesManager: Oh see, Running away.... I demand a free market\n\n... It's F*%$ing monday."

This is what I already know:\n\n* Basics of HTTP Request/Response\n* Python\n* Flask & Django\n* Basics of HTML & CSS(I mostly use Bootstrap in a project without much modification)\n* Basic SQL(I rarely work with raw SQL since there are ORMs)\n* Building Rest APIs\n* Basic JS & Jquery\n* Deployment on cloud\n* Edit: I also know GIT & CI/CD tools\n\nThis is what I am going to learn in the next few months:\n\n* Data Structures & Algorithms (Relearning as I don’t remember most algorithms)\n* React & later React native for mobile dev\n* Docker\n* MongoDB or some other NoSQL database\n* Async I/O\n\nI am wondering if I should learn networking also. I know the very basics of socket programming but haven’t gone beyond creating a simple P2P messaging client. Is there anything else you think I should know?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention - I currently work as a freelancer mostly backend development and scripting."

I then watched it another 2 times and in a much slower pace and understood what is being taught. However when it comes to applying the theories i am absolutely zero. I ended up looking through another answer and still tried to make my own based on what i understood from those answers but still couldnt figure it out and practically copied it after trying for more than a week. \n\nIs this how it is for beginners or am i really bad considering that i noticed people have finished it within hours and some within days of watching the lectures. I know different people have different speed but i am at a total loss here.\n\n Is there another way i should approach this problem? Or should i look to learn somewhere else or something else\n\n!!Update: should i consider learning a more easier language like python so i can understand the functions and mechanics and then move on to harder ones?"

They're mostly like 30 minutes of just talking about what we've been doing, dev team meetings are mostly looking at the Github milestones and reviewing how we've been doing, standups are basically reviewing the work we've been doing recently and discussing what's happening today, just catching up with each other and staying on track in general.\n\n\n**12:30**: Gym time wooo 💪. I replace my lunch with this, which is why I arrive a bit earlier than the typical 9-5. A surprisingly good way to break up working all day. They're nice enough to not track my hours and be strict about how long I spend.\n\n**5:15**: Between lunch and the end of the day there might be a meeting, but usually after lunch, I just quietly code away until I leave. On some days we have little birthday parties and small things like that to make work seem less work-like I suppose, these usually happen around 4:30-5.\n\n___\n\n\n## **Code Expectation vs Reality**\n\n### **Expectations**:\n1. When I accepted the offer I had never used Vue before, so I had to get up to speed with using Vue instead of React before I could even do anything. I expected to be pretty useless and struggle with it quite a lot.\n\n2. I expected working in a team would be hard, I had no idea how they would manage Git and I had limited experience interacting with others using Git. I knew the fundamentals but obviously, I had never worked on a team before.\n\n3. JavaScript knowledge wise I wasn't too concerned, I was quite sure I knew a lot about JS in general, especially for a junior role. \n\n4. I expected things to be very strict and limited, tests, comments.\n\n5. I thought my ideas and things I knew wouldn't be needed or wanted *(e.g in meetings I should just do whatever the senior says to do because I'm the junior)*\n\n\n### **Reality**:\n1. Vue isn't that different from React, I was able to transfer a lot of knowledge. I'm still not as comfortable with Vue as I was with React even now though, but I'm getting there. *(The senior dev is very active in the Vue Land discord chat helping people - so being able to ask questions and get in-depth answers directly related to work makes life a lot easier.)*\n\n2. Working in a team isn't as difficult as I expected. I make a branch and push my changes, making a PR for review when I'm done. The most confusing thing I've had to do is branch off a few times and merge conflicts. I keep it **very** simple 🤠.  \n\n3. JavaScript wise I've learned a few things (and taught some stuff too), my expectations were about right that I knew enough general JS.\n\n4. There's linting enforced, some stuff is tested (but not a lot!) and comments are a luxury. Most code is not commented, which is not too bad if it's descriptive, but some confusing things that are hidden away are quite exactly that, hidden away. Reality is far from what they show you.\n\n5. The dev team was kind of unhappy that I didn't give my opinions more often and brought it up in one of my reviews early on, saying I had good ideas but didn't tend to let people know about them. As time has gone on I've been putting my ideas out there more and the other devs seem to agree with me, so in general, everyone seems happy to share ideas, there's no longer a \"but you're a junior!\" feeling and my ideas are welcomed.\n\n___\n## **Work Expectation vs Reality**\n\n### **Expectations**:\n\n1. I honestly had no idea what to expect, I had no clue about any finance stuff at all, I expected to be totally overwhelmed with finance words I didn't understand.\n\n2. I imagined that the typical 9 to 5 work hours would leave me with a lot of free time after work and that I'd spent at least 7 of those actually writing code.\n\n3. I expected to be bad at soft skills, for sure.\n\n4. I'm way less intelligent than everyone else, they all went to uni and I'm a dropout. \n\n\n### **Reality**:\n\n1. The financial side of the business is mostly handled by other people, there is a lot of things people say I still don't get...But I don't really have to when I need to understand them, I just ask a few questions and get a general idea of how it works, combined with a bit of googling on the subject if needed.\n\n2. Most of my time is spent not writing code, like 50% at best. 10-20% is taken up just by meetings or just talking to people. The rest is reading code, code reviews or being on a break. I also have almost no free time, by the time I get home and get all my daily required things done I just want to go to sleep. I was entirely not used to this compared to my previous habits of writing code for 14 hours a day.\n\n3. I am bad at soft skills. I can't bring myself to talk to people for no reason at all. We're separated on 2 floors - I rarely see people on the other floor & I leave the office at lunch so the only real way to talk to them is to relocate myself to the other floor.\n\n4. Pretty much true. I have a lot less random school-related knowledge. I am just uneducated outside of what I've taught myself.\n\n\n___\n\n**TL;DR**: My expectations vs reality of starting my first job has been that things are a lot easier and way more relaxed than I expected. I am indeed just a bit of an awkward developer that wants to write code and not chat about random stuff in the kitchen. 🤷\n___\n\n\n\n## **Tips and stuff I found important**\n\n\n### **Git**\n\nObviously working with a team Git will be the most important thing to understand teamwork wise, I feel if you can do all the basics *(clone, push, pull, merge, make a PR, etc)* you'll be fine.\n\nWe do things slightly differently to what I expected here, we make a branch and push to it and then merge it after review. *(using Github labels to figure out what's going on)*.\n\n\n \n### **Ask questions**\n\n\nGetting the right balance of how many questions you ask is important, if you ask too few you'll get stuck on small things too often, if you ask too many you'll be wasting a lot of time.\n\nIt's hard to say what the right amount is, but if you ask the right types of questions it doesn't matter how many you ask.\n\nIf you can google it *(e.g the question is a generic question about JS)* then google it. If you feel like asking in person just to discuss it a bit, you can.\n\n\nIf the question is codebase specific then just ask it.\n\n\nIf you're stuck for over like 30-40 minutes just staring at the screen wondering why something won't work, ask for help. Sometimes all it takes is someone to look at the same thing and they'll spot something you didn't right away. *(This doesn't have to be in person, you can ask a random person in a chat or stack overflow, etc.)*\n\n\nOverall you have to kind of humble yourself and not feel shy or ashamed to ask for help, even if it's a small thing. Being a junior gives you the perfect excuse anyway 🤠. They want you to ask questions.\n\n\n\n### **Find what works for you**\n\nPersonally, I spend a lot of time on discord discussing code with others, sometimes I'm \"at work\" but solving someone else's problem, teaching something or just talking random code stuff.\n\nThis almost sounds bad, like I'm wasting company time... But honestly, I feel taking breaks from what I'm doing helps me just feel happier with what I'm doing overall.\n\nI feel like I'm able to do what I want, when I want - as long as I do the work at an expected pace and I'm becoming a better developer at the same time, I feel this is exactly what I **want** to be doing.\n\nI expected \"working\" to be a miserable thing I did to earn money, but by being able to just break it up and do what I enjoy *(gym & chilling discussing code)*, I feel way happier and enjoy going to work.\n\n\n\n### **Code reviews are good**\n\nYou can learn a **lot** from code reviews 😸! \n\nNot just people reviewing your code, but reviewing other people's code and also looking at reviews other people made unrelated to your code.\n\nYou have to understand you are not your code. If someone says you did something wrong, you shouldn't be upset they're saying you did it wrong, they're saying the code you wrote isn't correct. Everyone has times when they're tired and the code just isn't good, it happens. 🤷\n\n\n\n### Take notes\n\nI wrote up notes of most things that were confusing to me. There was a LOT of things done in a very specific way I'd never seen before, specific to our codebase only.\n\nThe problem with asking questions is that you'll get an answer, but if you don't come across that thing again. You may have forgotten the next time it comes up. \n\n\nI use markdown to write notes and then when writing something for GitHub I just copy/paste it in there as part of the Issue/PR and it's already in the correct format. \n\n\n___\n\n\nAnd that's about it, I've probably missed a few things as the time has just kind of flown by, but I think everything is going fine and all my reviews have been overly positive, the transition from self-taught to \"proper\" work has been fine.\n\n...Now I just have to hope coronavirus doesn't make me unemployed 😷."

Maybe I’m just realizing now something that’s always been there, but Dan Brown’s writing style is so clunky that it’s ruining the book for me. The fact that he interjects with another art history fact twice a page just pulls me out of the story so much that it’s actually disengaging. And his cringeworthy over-use of adjectives just gets silly at times. While I try not to be a pretentious reader and just enjoy a book for what it is, I can’t deny that I just want to call it quits and never read a Brown book again. I guess I’m writing this cause I’m curious if anyone else agrees or if I’m just an exception. Any thoughts?"

The Latin term was borrowed from the Germanic adjective meaning &quot;of the people&quot; but, unlike it, was used only to refer to languages. In Medieval Western Europe non-native Latin was the language of science, church and administration, hence Latin theodiscus and its Germanic counterparts were used as antonyms of Latin, to refer to the &quot;native language spoken by the general populace&quot;. They were subsequently used in the Frankish Empire to denote the native Germanic vernaculars. As such, they were no longer used as antonym of Latin, but of walhisk, a language descendant from Latin, but nevertheless the speech of the general populace as well.[1] In doing so Latin theodiscus and the Germanic reflexes of *þiudiskaz effectively obtained the meaning of &quot;Germanic&quot;, or more specifically one of its local varieties – resulting in the English exonym Dutch, the German endonym Deutsch, the Dutch exonym Duits, and the Dutch endonym Diets, all of which are cognates of theodiscus, which in Italian yielded tedesco.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tl;dr: It used to describe the language of the people i.e. not Latin or French and then there was time. </p>\n\n<p>Since for the longest time there was no <em>one</em> unified Germany but a lot of German speaking countries, the names in other languages are so different. The English call us Germany after the Latin Germania, the French call us Allemagne referring to the Germanic tribe of the Alemanni in the Southwest of today&#39;s Germany that bordered the French territories. The Scandinavians use Tyskland which has the same etymology as Deutschland (see above) and in Finnish we&#39;re called Saksa iirc, from the Germanic tribe of the Saxons. In most Slavic languages, like e.g. Polish with Niemcy, we&#39;re the &quot;mute ones&quot; as in those that don&#39;t speak the local (Slavic) language.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Germany\">It&#39;s a bit weird.</a></p>\n</div>",

Sure, you might be able to remove completed torrents after some number of days or certain ratio… but none of that really worked well for me and my private trackers. \n\nSo I rolled my own solution: [**ArrJanitor**](https://github.com/NickBrecht/ArrJanitor)\n\nArrJanitor seeks to clean up downloads from Radarr/Sonarr (within Deluge!) when higher quality torrents have been downloaded. However, it does allow for lower quality torrents to seed for several days (default is 4 days) before being removed from Deluge (+ deleting the data).\n\nThis allows users to seed torrents perpetually unless they are replaced. It also lets members of private tracker communities avoid H&Rs. ArrJanitor does support 2 instances of Radarr, 2 instances of Sonarr, and 1 instance of Deluge. \n\nI’ll be the first to say that this project has been a damn case study on scope creep. Some areas are over engineered while others are dreadfully under engineered. But hey, it works well. \n\nI designed ArrJanitor to live within one single python script and be able to be easily ran from CA UserScripts after configuring a python environment from NerdPack. More detailed instructions are in the How section in the ReadMe on Github.\n\nWhile I did intend for this to be ran from UserScripts in UnRaid, any python >3.6 environment should be able to run it with minor alterations.\n\n\nFeel free to message/comment if you have any questions, comments, or requests."

It's specifically concerned with Japanese, but similar to some of the posts I've shared recently, each section features discussions that would be relevant to a wider audience.\n\nA few years ago I wrote [a very long response](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/6q6hrm/usuikacider_writes_a_long_indepth_post_on/) to a guy who had a year to prepare before arriving to Japan. It was surprisingly well received, currently in LearnJapanese community's starter guide and since then I've gotten tons of messages from people asking further questions.\n\nI've kept track of what people felt my first write-up was missing and how I responded, in case the same question came up later, and about six months ago began feeling like it had gotten out of hand. So I began organizing it. It's currently got 60 pages of single-spaced content, plus links to hundreds of pages further reading, dozens of hours of further watching and several books.\n\nSo, anyhow, hope it helps.\n\nA Year to Learn Japanese: [live document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bRzVblKVOsQJjTc2PIi1Gbj_LrsJCkMkh0SutXCZdI/edit#heading=h.ff9mg4fv0ytd)|[published document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSdMfy94dB8shZHsY47SE1vDlgz3DvP397tattPPLIMKqBn7x3bMi_FJPj85-YSE7Fcqz18g73GDfs7/pub) (less readable due to formatting/lack of document outline... but can support more concurrent viewers)\n\nEdit: [Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C50jtM2RDvShT2Q8kvbPKpwWJ5k_ymxN) with a public copy of the document and also a .pdf file, so that the pains I took in getting page alignment just right won't go to waste, haha. You should be able to download these files.\n\nEdit II: I've added a to-do list section, in which I list changes/additions I plan to make [based on feedback people have left me in survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdokDQ2TMaxEUY-RFbc5-gcFc9GAZ99xzVNR5Fa2fX0Pr3LaA/viewform?usp=sf_link).\n\nContents:\n\n* **Introduction:** how long does it take to learn Japanese? Why learn Japanese? Why listen to me? etc. *5 pages, done.*\n* **General Learning:** stuff not directly related to Japanese but that is still important to be a successful learner; also includes links to 11 other learning-timelines. *6 pages, done. Moved to appendix.*\n* **Pronunciation:** in half a page and 30 minutes of video for people who don't care, 10 further pages covering IPA/pitch accent/prosody for people who do. *10 pages, done*.*.. revised to version 2.*\n* **Kana:** introduction to katakana/hiragana with options for people who prefer reading/watching/flashcards, plus a general intro to how memory works. *3 pages, done.*\n* **Kanji:** how they work, where they came from, how to get through them and some FAQs. How I personally got through them, plus a relatively neutral introduction to six common approaches. *13 pages, done*.\n* **Grammar:** high level overview of EN/SP/JP grammar, how the way you look at grammar will change over time, \\~six separate levels of discussion that cover N5 to N1 and review/test prep. *11 pages, done*.\n* **Vocabulary**: which word do you need? How many? Why is it that you can know all the words on a page but not understand what was said? *13/14 pages done.*\n* **Input:** two tracks, a discussion of how to get started with reading and with audio/visual content. Some practical stuff like where to get started and how, some less practical stuff like routine and transitioning out of more formal studies. *Mostly done, needs revision.*\n* **Output:** what each level of learner should be looking to get out of a tutoring session/conversion and how to approach it, based on 4 years of experience tutoring kids/working adults and 5 years studying 4 languages, three of which I've lived in/had to perform in daily. *Currently writing as of July 2020.*\n\nInterviews\n\n* **Idahosa Ness on Pronunciation**: *Finalized, included.* Discussion on how to begin working on pronunciation even if you're clueless, common mistakes from English speakers and how to transition from pronunciation practice to speaking practice.\n* **Matt vs Japan on Kanji, Pitch Accent and The Journey**: *Finalized, included.* Discussion on learning the kanji and pitch accent, how to get the most out of Anki and the general journey that is learning Japanese.\n* **Nelson Dellis on Memory and Language Learning**: How a 4x US memory champion approached Dutch, how having a trained/super memory does and doesn't help learn a language. Interview done, not finalized, not yet included\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n* **Steve Kaufman on Input**: Currently preparing interview proposal.\n* **\\[Somebody\\] on Output**: Had wanted to include Michael Campbell, who runs Glossika, but he's sort of hard to reach.\n* **Dōgen on Post-Fluency & Creativity in a Second Language:** Tentatively scheduled for late 2020. Dogen's a busy guy.\n* **Brian Rak on Making a Living with Japanese:** *Finalized, included.* The founder of Satori Reader, Brian, talks a bit about what it took to turn a passion into a job and what he thinks it takes to find a job with languages.\n\nA special thanks to u/virusnzz, who has spent a significant bit of time going through some of the document. It would be *much* less readable without his valuable input."

I've found a lot of posts claiming that nodejs is unfit for ecommerce because it's not mature enough yet or it is not fit to use together with relational databases, etc. So what do you think? Is there a lack of ecommerce tools/plugins to build a complete functional and secure ecommerce site? And is there really an issue using nodejs together with relational databases? In general, Is nodejs a less appropriate alternative for ecommerce than let's say Django or Wocommerce? If that's the case, then why?\n\nAll thoughts and ideas are highly appreciated!"

Expands off the vanilla game but has Morrowind-like loot and survival elements. Tons of additional quest mods. Centered around Legacy of the Dragonborn, a big museum to fill up with every damn item you can get your greedy hands on. A completionist&#39;s wet dream.</p>\n\n<p>Next are two Requiem based modlists. If you want to play a brand new Skyrim try Requiem. It&#39;s a strict rebuttal against the ongoing trend of dumbing down Bethesda games. It&#39;s an Old-school RPG overhaul. The combat in it is pure adrenaline and will kick your ass until you git gud Dark Souls style. Prepare to cautiously wander around Skyrim with your butt puckered, frequently noping out of places.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimate Skyrim for LE 2011 or Total Skyrim Overhaul for SSE. TSO has Legacy of the Dragonborn while UltSky doesn&#39;t. Ultimate Skyrim will come to SSE eventually. Both are really good Requiem modlists. Use Wabbajack to download and install the whole list, just need Nexus Premium. Hope you have good internet and a lot of spare time ;) <a href=\"https://www.wabbajack.org/\">https://www.wabbajack.org/</a></p>\n</div>",

              "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>One moment, I was sitting in my room watching Youtube; the next, I was standing next to a massive banquet table in a circular room with nine other kids my age, looking just as confused as I was. The table had dozens of dishes on it, filled with more food than any buffet I had ever visited.</p>\n\n<p>“Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!”, a loud voice rang out. We all looked up to see a boy watching us from a balcony on the other side of the room. He didn’t look that much different from us if you ignored the green snake eyes that he had and the curled horns on either side of his head. He clapped his hands together and started floating in the air. “Welcome to the 2020 Superpower Feast. Please select a food in front of you and I’ll give you a superpower based on that food!”</p>\n\n<p>We all stared at him for a few moments, too stunned to say anything. Then, one girl with brown curly hair spoke up. “Are you saying...are you telling us that you’re the one giving 16 years old superpowers every decade?” she asked in a dazed voice.</p>\n\n<p>“Yep, that’s me,” he replied with a sly grin. “Of course, I make sure to always wipe their memories before they leave this place.” “So,” he said, looking around at all of us. “Who wants to go first?”</p>\n\n<p>There was a tense silence for several moments. The boy yawned. “Well, don’t all volunteer at once.” His voice took on a more serious edge. “But, really, do choose something before I get bored and choose a grateful group of teenagers that does want superpowers.”</p>\n\n<p>One boy wearing glasses slowly walked over to the banquet table. We all watched him nervously as he picked up a plate that contained several slices of steak and began eating from it. Suddenly, we heard him gasp. Before, he had been fairly skinny. But now, right in front of our stunned eyes, massive muscles were appearing all over his arms and legs. The boy floating over us smiled and clapped his hands. Both the boy in glasses and the plate of half eaten steaks vanished from the room. “Don’t worry about him,” he said, gazing down at us. “I just sent him back to Earth. He’ll wake up, thinking that he was blessed with superpowers while he was sleeping. He giggled. “Well, who’s next?”</p>\n\n<p>I raised my hand. “You said that we can eat anything from this table and we’ll get a superpower from it, right?”</p>\n\n<p>“Yep, that’s right,” he said, floating over to me. “So, what do you want?”</p>\n\n<p>I walked over to one corner of the banquet table, readied my nerves and bit into the table. I could feel everyone staring at me. I looked up at the floating boy and for the first time, I saw him look just as baffled as everyone in the room. “What...what are you doing? “ he asked, tilting his head.</p>\n\n<p>“You said that we choose anything from the table. Well, I’m choosing the table then.”</p>\n\n<p>There was a tense silence as we stared at each other. For a moment, I was worried that I had offended him. Then, he started laughing hysterically. “My gods, I forget how crazy you humans can be sometimes.” “Well,” he said with a devilish grin. “You can certainly eat the table if you want. But you have to actually swallow part of it. A simple bite isn’t enough.”</p>\n\n<p>I nervously gulp. It takes fifteen minutes of me constantly stabbing the table corner with a fork before part of it breaks off. The entire time, I can feel the rest of the kids looking at me, probably thinking that I’m a fool or a lunatic. But I’ve already committed to this. It’s too late to back off down. I put the piece in my mouth. It’s even more disgusting than I imagined, foul and rotten with sharp edges poking into  my gums. But, I manage to swallow it without vomiting.</p>\n\n<p>“.Well, well, well,” the boy says, smirking. “You know, you’re the first person in 500 years to consider eating the table. I think that such creativity deserves a unique reward, wouldn’t you say?”</p>\n\n<p>He slowly descended from the air until his feet touched the ground. He pulled out a red book from his jacket pocket and handed it over to me. “Only you will be able to read this. Do take good care of it. I have a feeling that you’re going to be very interesting to watch indeed.”</p>\n\n<p>“What is it?”, I asked, struggling to talk against the waves of nausea coming from my stomach.</p>\n\n<p>“My cookbook,” he said, laughing, before clapping his hands together.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Parts 2 and 3 are down below!</p>\n</div>",

Web scraper that indexes to solr or Elasticsearch.\n2. Do something with AMPQ. I struggle to understand what this protocol is supposed to really be used for. \n3.

I got inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/fg3pkt/signal_private_messenger_is_using_google_recaptcha/) on the sub.\n\nI have sort of finalized my project goals and see no problem integrating features in the next few weeks (As a university student I am usually busy for side projects but things have pivoted recently due to world events).\n\n**Here is the basic feature list (I am posting here to get better ideas and implementation tips)**\n\n# End of week:\n\n* **Basic 3x3 \"Choose an image matching topic\" window**\n   * Passes answers to node server and the node server will compute if you choose the right topic based on the images tagged in a MongoDB with their \"topic\". Pass a token back to the client that will verify with the 3rd party server on form submit.\n* **Self hosted console**\n   * Written in python\n   * Pulls thousands of random images with topics from a photo server <- I need to figure out implementation of this\n   * Update \"Security Mode\" Logs etc\n   * Other maintenance features (Update host-name and XSS settings)\n\n# Next few weeks:\n\n* Automatically track user integration across page and apply a score similar to ReCAPTCHA\n   * Privacy Concerns mitigated with self hosted option or can be disabled all together\n   * This will reduce interrupting the user every time they need to submit, getting in their way less\n* Add an API site so that people can use my server if they don't want to self-host, API limited to whatever I need to do to save my servers from dying a node asynchronous death.\n\nI would really appreciate any criticism or contributions and if you **really** want to you can follow along on my trello board for the project or the GitLab that I have setup for the time being. I will try to post an update here for first working release if people seem interested.\n\n[Gitlab](https://gitlab.platinumnetworks.ca/imp4ct/mecaptcha)\n\n* ~~ReadOnly till I move it to GitHub, also~~  empty till I can make an Alpha release that isn't just random scratch code\n   * I will be leaving it on my GitLab and opening up sign-ups later if people want to contribute\n* I will **try my best** to do proper documentation as I go but that may have to come later\n* If you would like to contribute financially to the project the readme now has a few options included.\n\n[Trello](https://trello.com/b/E8Zm96wC/mecaptcha)\n\n* My Boards get out of hand quick so don't expect all the ideas you see to get implemented.\n* Im sorry it's Trello but I will try to move it to a purpose hosted Wekan later when I have the time/bored of coding"

If they probably do contain the object, move the images to one folder, while if they don't, move it to another. I have been seeing a lot about using ImageAI, but I have not been able to get that to work and I cannot find any info relating to what I am trying to do. I honestly don't know that much about coding, which is why I am asking here. I would prefer it to be free, but it is okay if I have to spend some money, but I have seen some services cost large amounts of money which just is not worth it. I would just rather not have the program run on the cloud, rather on my own computer since I should have good enough hardware to run it."

We compared multiple tools such as google bazel, facebook buck, ninja and plain old cmake. At the end of the day we figured that none of them matched our exact needs.\n\nEventually we reached tup, which looked very promising. The issue with tup was the lack of strong remote caching. Initially we wanted to improve tup to match our needs. After a while we figured that we should just build something new. With all the good stuff that we took from tup and strong caching like sccache from mozzila. The result was a brand new tool - umake. It is fast (really fast), easy to use and correct. No more building the same binary in the office if someone else already built it. No more running make -j10 and getting broken results. It just works, and it works fast.\n\nI'll be happy to hear your thoughts on the topic.\n\nFor more details check out: https://drivenets.com/blog/the-inside-story-of-how-we-optimized-our-own-build-system/ https://github.com/grisha85/umake/"

I seem to spend most of my time having to justify a very reasonable price of £400 for a whole website. \n\nThe rest of my time is spent panicking about generating leads through Google Ads and Facebook. It's the never-ending convoluted digital marketing tactics to generate a lead that has worn me thin...\n\nI'm done, I can't be fucked with it. All of the above is making me hate what I do. I've never had any stability in my life. I'm 33 now, I just want stability and peace of mind. I've never worked for anyone in my life. I've always made my own way. I've literally never been employed and I've been homeless twice.\n\nI love coding. After my interesting, but ultimately misdirected 20's, I had to sort my life out because at 29 I was broke, I had no skills and was completely unemployable. I taught myself web development by watching youtube & udemy courses. I know HTML5, CSS, Boostrap, Javascript, React, PHP, Wordpress and MongoDB. \n\nI've been building websites for small businesses as a freelancer for 3 years. Recently a friend of mine started dating a new woman through another one of our friends. She's an IT recruitment consultant at big global recruitment company. \n\nI didn't know this when we first met. She asked me what I did and I just said I was a web developer. Immediately her eyes lit up. She just starting enthusiastically asking me \"do you know javascript?, do you know php?, do you know wordpress, do you know magento?\"\n\nI said yes to all, at which point she started saying that she can get me £400 - £500 per day as a contractor. She was basically saying they have contracts with all these companies etc and they just send me wherever I'm needed and for however long. So I might be doing contract work for British Airways for a month and then 2 months for some other big company etc.\n\nFrom what has been said already, it seems like they handle everything and all i've got to do is just code. I don't have to worry about finding new work, negotiating things etc.\n\nThe problem is that I don't feel confident to say yes. I taught myself how to code in my late 20's and I've only been doing web development work for small local businesses.  I've never worked as a developer in a team or on big projects or for big companies.\n\nI live in one of the biggest cities in the UK and half of my friends work in recruitment. Another friend has made similar offers many times before as he's an IT recruiter for Hayes Recruitment. \n\nSO.... my question is what do I need to do/learn to confidently say yes to these offers? I know all this stuff but only in the capacity of working from home on my own.\n\nThanks"

So i need help :)\n\nPeople contact me through my web design/development ads and then I immediately reply to them within 24 hours.\n\nI propose to have a short 15 mins meeting to discuss their needs. Around 70% of people just don't bother replying back or show no interest. I'm guessing this is normal. This is not my problem though. Anyways, here is what I say : \n\n`Hi X,`\n\n`I’d love to hear more about your project and better understand your needs. Would you be available this X  or this X for a 15 mins online meeting?`  \n`I’ll be waiting for you here: (link here for our meeting)`\n\n`Please confirm which date and time is best for you.`\n\n`Have a good day`\n\n`Zak`\n\n`My phone number and email`\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I do talk to them, they're always so clueless. The only words that  leave their mouth is : \"I need website\" and \"a simple website\". \n\nHere is when the problem starts : During the meeting they don't know what pages they want, what to put in their website or have any images. So sure, I offer them my help for free. I ask them if I can have the names of some of their competitors to check out their websites and see what they put online (for inspiration). They often don't know who their competitors are... \n\nI ask them if they would want an \"About Us\" section. \n\n­> \"I'm not sure, probably.\"\n\nI ask them to tell me more about their business to write in the page :\n\n\\> \"I started not long ago, so I'm not too sure what to say about myself\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if I give them a lead on where to find inspiration for their text or try to help them.... THEY JUST DON'T KNOW. It's so frustrating... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd of course to finish it off..  \"How much will it cost me\"\n\nIn order for me to give out an estimation, I need to have an idea of the overall time it will take me to complete the website. I charge per hour, not per project. This normally means how many pages, having the text, or having a good idea of the content. But it's very hard with little to no information...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSoooo.... I ask them to prepare the text and offer my help to write it and tell them I can only give out an estimation with the text/pages or with more info... And that's when I never hear back."

Vmware/ESXi, back up solution, on-site storage along with off-site in one of our various hubs (we own a fiber ring that service a variety of places), manage switches, firewalls and carrier routers, mostly windows servers with some Linux servers doing a few different jobs, cisco CUCM phones and collaboration etc.\n\nSo it's not like I'm sitting here doing the same thing daily/weekly like some people might do at large businesses/corporations.  I might have to provision a new user VM once a year or so?  The most repetitive thing I do would probably be upgrading stuff and making sure everyone is up to date on windows update, but I've got WSUS to handle that.  But that kinda sucks lol.  So I'm not really sure what I can be automating."

              "selftext": "***Why is Bitcoin so hard for most people to understand?*** \n\n\"The reason it's so hard for most people to understand is that most people don't really understand money. Money isn't wealth. It's an accounting system used to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one actually wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that Bitcoins are 'just data'. But that's what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person's wants or needs).\n\nTo put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is decentralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular  payment from being processed. We've had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the 'ledger' of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the 'accounting entries' in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient for global transactions. \n\nAnd this is why bitcoin is important! It is the first currency in the world that is both decentralized and digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold and more private and transactionally efficient than \"modern\" digital banking. This is why people are excited about bitcoin, it has the potential to completely revolutionize money.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought I'd share it with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave a good Sunday everybody!\n\nEDIT: url to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kubGCSj5y3k&t=354s"

I suspect many governments will inflate their currencies even more than they already do.\n\nRegardless, Bitcoin is entering uncharted territory for the first time in its existence....  beating the US dollar in an important benchmark.  It will be close, but BTC will have the slight edge.  I am not educated enough to predict ramifications of this, but it's not a trivial milestone.\n\nAny thoughts on BTC passing the USD?\n\n**EDIT:  many posters have corrected my misconception...  I indeed am comparing apples and oranges.  I should have been comparing the \"new\" supply of BTC (although that itself is debateable) to newly created currency (though that gets tricky too, with fractional reserves).  Long story short, it's more complicated than I set out.  I'll leave my statements up so others can see what a fool I am, and point and laugh as they see fit.  Be kind to one another, we are all here for love of BTC.**"

I wanted to create my own design language because the rest of them just felt too complex, too outdated, or too branded (for example Bootstrap is too old, Material UI is too Google-y).\n\nI wanted a design system that wasn’t too complicated or special but just something that’s unbranded and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nAnyway 30 days from realizing that, I have a design system I’m ready to share!\n\nIt’s called “Hacker UI” and I’m currently pitching it as “the hacker’s go-to design system” (similar to how Bootstrap was a go-to).\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 25+ components\n- 25+ codesandbox examples\n- New CSS-in-JS solution\n- Composable styles by default \n- Full Typescript support\n\n**Be warned, the project is still young!**\n\nThere’s still a lot to be done with this library (mobile-friendly docs, optimizations, SSR support, a11y audits, CI and testing, animations etc) but I’m still super excited to share. I'm more posting to gauge interest for possible contributors at this time.\n\nPlease let me know what you think!\n\n- [docs at hacker-ui.com](https://hacker-ui.com/)\n- [github repo](https://github.com/ricokahler/hacker-ui)\n\n---\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the feedback and support. I've created [an issue on the GitHub for a rough idea of a roadmap/timeline for a stable 1.0 release](https://github.com/ricokahler/hacker-ui/issues/6). Check it out if you're curious!"

              "selftext": "All of us run our own businesses. I'm pretty sure everyone at this gathering had > 10y experience on top of any previous FT work. I respect them all, and admit to being envious of this or that part of their work from time to time...\n\nHere are a few of the stories:\n\n**My Last Web Developer Sucked**\n\nOne of the developers mentioned that some of us had probably heard bad things about her, but to keep in mind that at least some of it was from clients _she_ fired, not the other way around.\n\nI said that in my experience, it seems like at least 50% of the time somebody complains about somebody they worked with before, it's a huge red flag.\n\nOne of the others in the group said, \"no, it's more like 95%.\" He went on to share that whenever there has been a previous web developer, he reaches out to them no matter what the potential client says.\n\nHe had once emailed one of these past devs to inquire about a client, and the reply was \"(client) is a lying asshole--he's probably lied to you already.\" \n\nSo he went back to the potential client. The client had told him, \"I went through your entire website and reviewed every one of your projects, I read every word. They're amazing.\" He asked the client some simple questions about what he'd read. The guy sputtered and couldn't answer a single question.\n\nHe had checked in on the client's background with a casual Google search, and didn't see anything. Then he did a Google News search, and found out he had been sued many, many times, and his name was all over the media for hyper-unethical conduct.\n\n**I Consulted an Expert**\n\nOne of the others shared that she had to let a difficult client go, a local engineer just starting a business, who sent her a blistering critique of her work, provided by an \"expert\" third-party.\n\nShe responded to this client that it was only fair that she be allowed to know about the third party's qualification, experience, and insight into the client's project parameters, particularly his budget and the areas she spent the most time on. She had built an entire custom back end that the client hadn't even logged into yet.\n\nThere was no reply from the client, and then in the next week she received a letter by mail, requesting that she transfer all assets to the client's new web developer.\n\nShe called the new web developer, made calm but direct reference to the comments she received, and he instantly came clean. He was a \"web developer\" who was freelancing while finishing up his university studies. \n\nHe wrote the review. And his _uncle_ was the engineer client--he figured his uncle had told her all this already.\n\nSo literally this guy's nephew was trying to tell a veteran web developer that her work was unprofessional, and he had no insight into any of the project details other than what he saw on his screen.\n\nShe told him (broadly) what he'd need to know to set up the back end, and had he ever worked in this kind of environment before?\n\nWeeks later, the engineer's wife contacted her again, asking if there's any way she could just help them tie up a few loose ends! The nephew had become too busy at school. Needless to say they are looking elsewhere for help with any loose ends.\n\n**Web Development by Gaslight**\n\nLast one: Another one of us shared that he had been called in to consult on \"connecting our product database to our website, so people can purchase our products online.\"\n\nIt turns out the potential client had an old, terminal-mode product management system which they've been using since the 1990s. This does happen quite a bit, and if you like it, why not just maintain it--I think we all got that. And now they want to \"connect\" that to their website and voila, people can just add to cart and check out, and they're done.\n\nThe potential client immediately put the web developer in touch with their software consultant, who maintains the product management software. \"Hey I'm glad you called! They had another guy call, and he bailed, but I kept telling him--it's so easy!\"\n\nThe software consultant explained the process:\n\n- All you need to do is schedule the periodic processing of our export file.\n- Then you just need to parse that and update what's on the website.\n\nSee? Two steps!\n\nThe web developer asked for an export file to examine. Days went by and then he received what looked like a CSV file that had been edited by hand, or otherwise \"improved\" a bit, including some weird inconsistencies.\n\n\"This is just an example to look at,\" said the software consultant.\n\nIt turns out, it was missing TONS of important information, and raised a bunch of questions. He scheduled another call. The project consultant kept saying, \"well then we just need YOU to develop this other component on your end and show it to us, then we help you process the data into the format you need, then you work with it like this. It's easy!\" Then the product software guy related a story about how this kind of thing was _easy_, for _him_.\n\nSo this web developer had pretty much decided at this point: The product software guy is protecting his contract. In reality it's _hard_ to do this stuff and work with his system, but he doesn't want to lose this client, so he tells _them_ it's easy.\n\nThe developer just bailed at that point, but said that 5 years later, they still don't have an e-commerce site."

As a thank you, here's the story. *Note that I am not affiliated in any way and that I was not granted any other benefits for compiling this.*\n\n\n**The service and it's fee**\n\nThe service advertised a 2% fee - way below the rate of any other provider I know of. This caught my attention. \n\nI've been extremely disappointed by other providers. One wanted to charge USD 50 fixed and then even had the audacity to add a covert 4% premium on the chosen crypto's spot rate. This practice has become so standard, it's saddening.\n\nAnyway, after Lawrence from ShopinBit researched some options on how to obtain the product and provided his cost estimates, we decided on going for an alternative.\n\nBefore I payed, I checked the current XMR spot rate as I always do - and as you should do too. To my surprise the applied conversion rate was current-to-the-minute and even slightly in my favor. No premium added.\n\nOnce the order was finalized I mostly forgot about it, but Lawrence noticed that the delivery took longer than expected and took charge of resolving the issue. I received the product in perfect condition, but before this, it had to go through my remailer for additional obfuscation:\n\n\n**How to receive physical goods anonymously**\n\nNow ShopinBit offers a remailing service, so the store you buy from doesn't know who the product goes to. However, this means you'll provide your address to ShopinBit.\n\nI preferred to use my own remailing service. There, my incoming packages are identified by my customer ID. Then the package is forwarded to an office address of mine.\n\nIn this particular case, my remailer asked the contents of the package before delivering it. Maybe the package origin (Netherlands) had to do with this (🤔). Maybe it's just routine when you don't provide your full name on the package.\n\nI wasn't bothered by the question, but the step added a one or two day delay in shipping which almost caused it to miss me on the location I was at at that time.\n\nLast minute - or rather exactly an hour before me being off to another continent -  I got the product. On the ride to the airport I discarded all the parts I didn't need and stuffed the rest into my luggage.\n\n\n**Does shopping physical goods on-line with Monero make sense?**\n\nSome people consider shopping for physical goods online and paying in XMR to make little sense. They'd give up their personal info in the delivery details anyway, so why bother paying a premium? My story is an example on how to tackle the issue to a certain extent.\n\nAnother simple solution is to just provide a different name and while you don't get the greatest anonymity you at least become less prone to be profiled - at no extra cost.\n\n\n**How the service could be improved?**\n\nThis is a rare idea, but as I am a proponent of **Monero as a currency**, instead of \"Monero as a payment method\", I'd love to see such a service announce that it keeps a certain amount in XMR instead of converting to fiat or anything else right away.\n\nI'd attribute extra points if such a service came up as Monero-only, as it would cause less friction for those new to crypto."

              "selftext": "Hi r/webdev, I'm a front-end engineer who loves building side-projects. My latest is an AI Art Generator. In this article I talk about the technology choices I made while building it, why I made them, and how they helped me launch the app a lot faster than I otherwise would have been able to. Note: I originally posted this on [Medium](https://medium.com/@angus.russell89/anatomy-of-an-ai-art-generator-app-13259e438ce5). I've stripped all mentions of the actual app to comply with this sub's self-promotion rules.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9kzq8l24uf41.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff0a8b5573676997b62f9317d64f957fa94f4945\n\n# First, a brief timeline\n\n**October 14, 2019** — Looking back at my commit history, this is the day I switched focus from validating the idea of selling AI-generated artworks, to actually building the app.\n\n**October 28** — 2 weeks later I sent a Slack message to some friends showing them my progress, a completely un-styled, zero polish “app” (web page) that allowed them to upload an image, upload a style, queue a style-transfer job and view the result.\n\n**October 30** — I sent another Slack message saying “It looks a lot better now” (I’d added styles and a bit of polish).\n\n**November 13** — I posted it to Reddit for the first time on r/SideProject and r/deepdream. Launched.\n\n# Requirements\n\nA lot of functionality is required for an app like this:\n\n* GPUs in the cloud to queue and run jobs on\n* An API to create jobs on the GPUs\n* A way for the client to be alerted of finished jobs and display them (E.g. websockets or polling)\n* A database of style transfer jobs\n* Authentication and user accounts so you can see your own creations\n* Email and/or native notifications to alert the user that their job is finished (jobs run for 5+ minutes so the user has usually moved on)\n* And of course all the usual things like UI, a way to deploy, etc\n\nHow did I achieve all this in under a month? It’s not that I’m a crazy-fast coder — I don’t even know Python, the language that the neural style transfer algorithm is built in — I put it down to a few guiding principles that led to some smart choices (and a few flukes).\n\n# Guiding Principles\n\n* No premature optimisation\n* Choose the technologies that will be fastest to work with\n* Build once for as many platforms as possible\n* Play to my own strengths\n* Absolute MVP (Minimum Viable Product) — do the bare minimum to get each feature ready for launch as soon as possible\n\nThe reasoning behind the first four principles can be summarised by the last one. The last principle — Absolute MVP — is derived from the lean startup principle of getting feedback as early as possible. It’s important to get feedback ASAP so you can learn whether you’re on the right track, you don’t waste time building the wrong features (features nobody wants), and you can start measuring your impact. I’ve also found it important for side-projects in particular, because they are so often abandoned before being released, but long after an MVP launch *could have* been done.\n\nNow that the stage has been set, let’s dive into what these “smart technology choices” were.\n\n# Challenge #1 — Queueing and running jobs on cloud GPUs\n\nI’m primarily a front-end engineer, so this is the challenge that worried me the most, and so it’s the one that I tackled first. The direction that a more experienced devops engineer would likely have taken is to set up a server (or multiple) with a GPU on an Amazon EC2 or Google Compute Engine instance and write an API and queueing system for it. I could foresee a few problems with this approach:\n\n* Being a front-end engineer, it would take me *a long time* to do all this\n* I could still only run one job at a time (unless I set up auto-scaling and load balancing, which I know even less about)\n* I don’t know enough devops to be confident in maintaining it\n\nWhat I wanted instead was to have this all abstracted away for me — I wanted something like AWS Lambda (i.e. serverless functions) but with GPUs. Neither Google nor AWS provide such a service (at least at the time of writing), but with a bit of Googling I did find some options. I settled on a platform called [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/). Here’s a quote from their home page:\n\n>*Data scientists never have to worry about infrastructure again*\n\nPerfect! Algorithmia abstracts away the infrastructure, queueing, autoscaling, devops and API layer, leaving me to simply port the algorithm to the platform and be done! (I haven’t touched on it here, but I was simply using an open-source style-transfer implementation in tensorflow). Not really knowing Python, it still took me a while, but I estimate that I saved *weeks or even months* by offloading the hard parts to Algorithmia.\n\n# Challenge #2 — The UI\n\nThis is me. This is my jam. The UI was an easy choice, I just had to play to my strengths, so going with React was a no-brainer. I used [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) initially because it’s the fastest way to get off the ground.\n\n*However*, I also decided — against my guiding principles — to use TypeScript for the first time. The reason I made this choice was simply that I’d been noticing TypeScript show up in more and more job descriptions, blog posts and JS libraries, and realised I needed to learn it some time — why not right now? Adding TypeScript definitely slowed me down at times, and even at the time of launch — a month later — it was still slowing me down. Now though, a few months later, I’m glad I made this choice — not for speed and MVP reasons but purely for personal development. I now feel a bit less safe when working with plain JavaScript.\n\n# Challenge #3 — A database of style-transfer jobs\n\nI’m much better with databases than with devops, but as a front-end engineer, they’re still not really my specialty. Similar to my search for a cloud GPU solution, I knew I needed an option that abstracts away the hard parts (setup, hosting, devops, etc). I also thought that the data was fairly well suited to NoSQL (jobs could just live under users). I’d used DynamoDB before, but even that had its issues (like an overly verbose API). I’d heard a lot about [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) but never actually used it, so I watched a few videos. I was surprised to learn that not only was Firebase a good database option, it also had services like simple authentication, cloud functions (much like AWS Lambda), static site hosting, file storage, analytics and more. As it says on the Firebase website, firebase is:\n\n>*A comprehensive app development platform*\n\nThere were also plenty of React libraries and integration examples, which made the choice easy. I decided to go with Firebase for the database (Firestore more specifically), and also make use of the other services where necessary. It was super easy to setup — all through a GUI — and I had a database running in no time.\n\n# Challenge #4 — Alerting the client when a job is complete\n\nThis also sounded like a fairly difficult problem. A couple of traditional options that might have come to mind were:\n\n* Polling the jobs database to look for a “completed” status\n* Keeping a websocket open to the Algorithmia layer (this seemed like it would be very difficult)\n\nI didn’t have to think about this one too much, because I realised — *after* choosing Firestore for the database — that the problem was solved. Firestore is a realtime database that keeps a websocket open to the database server and pushes updates straight into your app. All I had to do was write to Firestore from my Algorithmia function when the job was finished, and the rest was handled automagically. What a win! This one was a bit of a fluke, but now that I’ve realised it’s power I’ll definitely keep this little trick in my repertoire.\n\n# Challenge #5 — Authentication, Notifications and Deployment\n\nThese also came as a bit of a fluke through my discovery of Firebase. Firebase makes authentication easy (especially with the readily available React libraries), and also has static site hosting (perfect for a Create-React-App build) and a notifications API. Without Firebase, rolling my own authentication would have taken at least a week using something like Passport.js, or a bit less with Auth0. With Firebase it took less than a day.\n\nNative notifications would have taken me even longer — in fact I wouldn’t have even thought about including native notifications in the MVP release if it hadn’t been for Firebase. It took longer than a day to get notifications working — they’re a bit of a complex beast — but still dramatically less time than rolling my own solution.\n\nFor email notifications I created a Firebase function that listens to database updates — something Firebase functions can do out-of-the-box. If the update corresponds to a job being completed, I just use the SendGrid API to email the user.\n\nCreating an email template is always a pain, but I found the [BEE Free](https://beefree.io/) HTML email creator and used it to export a template and convert it into a [SendGrid Transactional Email Template](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Transactional_Templates/index.html) (the BEE Free template creator is miles better than SendGrid’s).\n\nFinally, Firebase static site hosting made deployment a breeze. I could deploy from the command line via the Firebase CLI using a command as simple as\n\n`npm run build && firebase deploy`\n\nWhich of course I turned into an even simpler script\n\n`npm run deploy`\n\n# A few things I learned\n\nThe speed and success of this project really reinforced my belief in the guiding principles I followed. By doing each thing in the fastest, easiest way I was able to build and release a complex project in under a month. By releasing so soon I was able to get plenty of user feedback and adjust my roadmap accordingly. I’ve even made a few sales!\n\nAnother thing I learned is that Firebase is awesome. I’ll definitely be using it for future side-projects (though I hope that this one is successful enough to remain my only side-project for a while).\n\n# Things I’ve changed or added since launching\n\nOf course, doing everything the easiest/fastest way means you might need to replace a few pieces down the track. That’s expected, and it’s fine. It *is* important to consider how hard a piece might be to replace later — and the likelihood that it will become necessary — while making your decisions.\n\nOne big thing I’ve changed since launching is swapping the front-end from Create React App to Next.js, and hosting to Zeit Now. I knew that Create React App is not well suited to server-side rendering for SEO, but I’d been thinking I could just build a static home page for search engines. I later realised that server-side rendering was going to be important for getting link previews when sharing to Facebook and other apps that use Open Graph tags. I honestly hadn’t considered the Open Graph aspect of SEO before choosing CRA, and Next.js would have probably been a better choice from the start. Oh well, live and learn!"

              "selftext": "There is so much wrong with Recaptcha it's not an exaggeration to say it should be legislated out of existence. \n\nAs web developer, by choosing to use Google Recaptcha you are imposing moral, legal, and technical barriers to your users.\n\n* Recaptcha is [terrible for usability](https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/) and effectively blocks disabled users from accessing websites. The audio challenges do not always work because they are seen as \"less secure\" than picture challenges and therefore using them means Google is more likely to judge you as being a robot.\n\n* Using Recaptcha contributes to Google's artificial intelligence network. Users are essentially being used as workers without any compensation.\n\n* Websites which implement Recaptcha are effectively forcing their users to agree to a second set of terms/conditions and a third party company's privacy and data processing policies. As if that wasn't bad enough, it's not just any company we're talking about here - it's Google; probably the most notorious company in the world in terms of data harvesting and processing.\n\n* Websites implementing Recaptcha almost never offer an alternative way of accessing their services, so if you don't agree with Google's terms and conditions then you are effectively blocked from using the first-party website. When this is a website like your bank or somewhere you've already purchased from (e.g. eBay uses Recaptcha) then you may end up blocked from accessing your own funds, details, order history, etc. Even if you (the developer) don't think Google's terms and conditions are objectionable, your end-users might disagree. They could also be in an environment where access to third-party domains, or Google domains specifically, is blocked. \n\n* Recaptcha's functionality [depends upon Google's online surveillance of you](https://www.fastcompany.com/90369697/googles-new-recaptcha-has-a-dark-side). If you use any kind of privacy-assuring settings or extensions in your web browser (e.g. blocking third-party cookies, trackers, etc.) the Recaptcha challenge is guaranteed to take at least 3-5 times longer to complete than if you bend over and accept Google's tracking.\n\n* Recaptcha introduces extra third-party dependencies to your website. One of Google's domains can't be reached or takes a while to load? User's network or browser security policy blocks those domains/scripts/etc.? Your user isn't able to use your site.\n\n* Recaptcha negatively affects performance. Recaptcha takes time to load on your visitors' browsers. Then it takes very considerable time to solve and submit the challenges; at least several seconds and sometimes minutes for unfortunate souls with strong privacy settings. \n\nEveryone has it drilled into their heads that \"each extra second of page load time results in a major drop-off in user engagement\" so why is nobody noticing that the onerous task of completing captchas is reducing user engagement too?\n\nI am not against captchas in general because I know there is a legitimate need for them. I am, however, against Recaptcha in all of its forms. It is an online monopoly and is an affront to consumer rights. \n\nI look forward to the day it's nuked from orbit and everyone involved in building it is imprisoned in the seventh circle of hell.\n\nFurther reading: https://kevv.net/you-probably-dont-need-recaptcha/\n\n# [Edit] Alternatives:\n\nSomething I really should have addressed in my original ~~rant~~ post is the possible alternatives to Recaptcha. A huge number of comments quite rightly ask about this, because unfortunately Recaptcha remains the most prominent solution when web developers look for a spam-prevention measure (despite the fact that Google's documentation on implementing Recaptcha is truly terrible... but that's a different issue).\n\nThe article above from [kevv.net](https://kevv.net/you-probably-dont-need-recaptcha/) mentions lots of alternatives and is worth reading, however for brevity's sake I will suggest the ones which have worked for me in a high-traffic environment, and which can be implemented by most competent developers in a few minutes:\n\n**1. Dead simple custom challenge based on your website's content.**\n\nEven a vaguely unique custom-made challenge will fool the majority of spam bots. Why? Because spam bots look for common captcha systems which they already know how to defeat. If you make your own custom challenge, someone actually has to take the effort to program a solution specific to your website. So unless your site is being specifically targeted by people investing time/energy this solution will eradicate virtually all spam.\n\nExample: run a site selling t-shirts? Show a bunch of cute clothing icons and ask the user to click on the \"blue shirt\", for example. Very easy to set up; challenges can be made random to prevent \"rinse and repeat\" attacks; complexity can be added in the form of patterns, rotation (\"click the upside down shirt with diamonds on it\") etc. and it can be styled to fit your website's theme/content which makes your site look way more professional than \"CLICK THE FIRE HYDRANTS!\" á la Google. \n\nImportant to note that *answers to the custom challenge should never be stored client-side -- only sever side*.\n\n**2. Honeypots**\n\nSimply one or more hidden form fields which, if submitted, confirms the presence of a spam bot (since human visitors cannot see or activate the hidden fields). Combine this with the approach above for even more effective protection.\n\n**3. Submit-once form keys (CSRF tokens)**\n\nIn the olden days to prevent people hotlinking your content you'd check their browser's referer URL, i.e. the URL from which they arrived at your page. This is still done but less commonly since many browsers block referrer URLs for privacy reasons. \n\nHowever, you can still check that a visitor who is submitting your form is doing so from your actual website, and not just accessing your `signup.php` script directly in an attempt to hammer/bruteforce/spam it. \n\nDo this by including a one-time-use \"form key\" on the page containing the spam-targeted form. The form key element (usually a hidden `<input>`) contains a randomly-generated string which is generated on the server-side and corresponds to the user's browsing session. This form key is submitted alongside the form data and is then checked (on the server side) against the previously-generated one to ensure that they match. If they do, it indicates that the user at least visited the page before submitting the form data. This has an added benefit of preventing duplicate submissions (e.g. someone hits F5 a few times when submitting) as the form key should change each time the front-end page is generated.\n\n**4. Two-factor authentication**\n\nIf your site is \"serious\" enough to warrant it, you can use 2FA to verify users via email/phone/secure key etc., although this comes with its own set of issues.\n\nAnyway, thanks for taking the time to consider this. \n\nWhile I'm here, I'd also like to encourage all developers to consider using the \"DNT (Do Not Track)\" feature which users can set in their browser to indicate they don't wish to be tracked.\n\nIt's as simple as wrapping your tracking code (Google Analytics etc.) inside the following code:\n\n    if (!navigator.doNotTrack) { // Google Analytics and other crap here }"

It is the website built for competitive programmers to let them practice their problem-solving skills.\n\nI have built an app [Laddy](https://laddy.app) that shows problems for your Codeforces rating so you can solve them and improve throughout the time. This app is inspired by [A2OJ](https://www.a2oj.com/) which is retired by now.\n\nEven though if you are not into competitive programming, you will be probably interested in the source code of Laddy which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/ironsoul0/laddy). It uses some cool technologies under the hood like TypeGraphQL, TypeORM, React + Typescript, Lerna for managing the monorepo, etc.\n\nAny suggestions for code improvement are more than welcome!\n\nIf you want to register but do not have a Codeforces handle, just copy-paste mine - **ironsoul** (just for testing).
